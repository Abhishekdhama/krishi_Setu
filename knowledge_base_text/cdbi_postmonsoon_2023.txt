highest (23.58ºC with an anomaly of 1.28ºC) since 1901. The minimum temperature was 2nd highest 
(19.20ºC with an anomaly of 1.46ºC) over Central India and highest (12.45ºC with an anomaly of 
1.25ºC) over Northwest India since 1901. 
 
Northeast Monsoon Activity : 
 
 
The southwest monsoon withdrew from the entire country on 19th October and northeast 
monsoon rains commenced from 21st October. Rainfall activity over core region of the South 
Peninsular India (comprising of 5 subdivisions viz. Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, Tamil Nadu, 
Puducherry and Kariakal, South Interior Karnataka and Kerala & Mahe) during the season as a whole 
was 94% of its LPA. It was 46% of its LPA during October, 117% of its LPA during November and 
229% of its LPA during December 
 
Rainfall Features: 
 
 
Rainfall realized over the country as a whole during the season was 91% of LPA. Most of the 
subdivisions received large excess / excess / normal rainfall, except a few from south peninsula, West 
Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Saurashtra & Kutch from remaining parts. During 
the season, out of 36 meteorological subdivisions, 3 received large excess rainfall, 4 received excess 
rainfall, 18 received normal rainfall, 10 received deficient rainfall and one sub division received large 
deficient rainfall (Fig.1). Table 1 shows the subdivision-wise rainfall statistics (mm) for the post-
monsoon season 2023. 
 
  
Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) show the spatial pattern of rainfall (mm) received during the season and its 
anomaly respectively. Parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, Sub Himalayan West Bengal 
& Sikkim, Rayalaseema, Tamilnadu, Puducherry & Karaikal, Kerala & Mahe and both the islands 
received more than 300 mm of rainfall. Parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Sub Himalayan West Bengal & 
Sikkim, Rayalaseema, Tamilnadu, Puducherry & Karaikal, Kerala & Mahe and both the islands received 
more than 400 mm of rainfall. Rainfall anomaly was more than 100 mm over parts of Arunachal 
Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, Sub Himalayan West Bengal & Sikkim, Gangetic West Bengal, 
Jharakhand, Bihar, East Uttar Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Puducherry & Karaikal Kerala & Mahe, South 
Interior Karnataka and both the islands. Magnitude of negative rainfall anomaly was more than 100 mm 
over parts of Odisha, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rayalaseema, North Interior Karnataka and 
South Interior Karnataka. 
 
 
Fig. 3(a) shows the area weight averaged cumulative weekly rainfall percentage departure 
during the season for the country as a whole. Cumulative rainfall departure was negative during all the 
weeks of the season except first week. At the end of the post-monsoon season 2023, the rainfall for the 
4 
 
country as a whole was 91.5 % of its LPA. Fig. 3(b) shows the area weight averaged cumulative weekly 
rainfall percentage departure during the season for the northeast monsoon region of south peninsula.  
At the end of the post-monsoon season 2023, the rainfall over the northeast monsoon region of south 
peninsula was 94 % of its LPA. 
 
Similarly, Fig. 3(c) shows the area weight averaged rainfall series for the season since 1901 
over the northeast monsoon region of south peninsula.  
 
 Fig. 4 shows area weight averaged rainfall series for post-monsoon season over all India and 
four homogeneous regions since 1951. Rainfall realized over the country as a whole was 91.5% of its 
LPA during the season. It was 99% of its LPA over northwest India, 78 % of its LPA over central India, 
110% if its LPA over east & northeast India and 87% of its LPA over south peninsula. 
 
Standardized Precipitation Index: 
 
The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is an index used for measuring drought and is 
based only on precipitation.  This index is negative for dry and positive for wet conditions. As the dry or 
wet conditions become more severe, the index becomes more negative or positive. Fig 5 (a & b) give 
the SPI values for the northeast monsoon season (October to December 2023 i.e. 3 months 
cumulative) and the year (January-December 2023, i.e.12 months cumulative) respectively. 
 
 
Cumulative SPI values of the past three months indicate extremely wet-severely wet conditions 
over parts of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Rajasthan, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, East Madhya 
Pradesh, East Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, Punjab, S.H.West Bengal & Sikkim and 
Gangetic West Bengal while extremely dry-severely dry conditions were  observed over parts of North 
Interior Karnataka, South Interior Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh state, Vidarbha, Telangana, 
Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram & Tripura.  
  
 
Cumulative SPI values of the past twelve months indicate extremely wet-severely wet 
conditions over parts of Uttar Pradesh state, Rajasthan state, West Madhya Pradesh, Saurashtra & 
Kutch, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, 
Telangana, A & N Islands, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand while extremely dry-severely dry 
conditions were observed over parts of East Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, South Interior Karnataka, 
Chhattisgarh, Madhya Maharashtra, Coastal Karnataka, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, 
Kerala, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura.  
 
Pressure & Wind: 
 
Figs. 6(a) & 6(b) show the mean sea level pressure & its anomaly respectively. The pressure 
anomaly was positive over most parts of country, except some parts of Gangetic West Bengal, West 
Rajasthan, and some parts of peninsula. The positive pressure anomaly was generally within 0.5 to 1.5 
hPa over most parts of the country. 
 
 
Figs. 7(a) & 7(b), 8(a) & 8(b) and 9(a) & 9(b), show the mean circulation pattern and its anomaly 
at 850, 500 & 250 hPa levels respectively. Wind anomaly at 850 hPa shows an anomalous anticyclonic 
circulation over western parts of peninsula and adjoining Arabian Sea. At 500 hPa level, an anomalous 
cyclonic circulation was observed over central India and adjoining Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. At 
250 hPa level, an anomalous cyclonic circulation was observed over central India and adjoining Arabian 
Sea and Bay of Bengal.

Velocity Potential & Stream Function: 
 
 
Figs. 10(a) & 10(b) show the 250 hPa mean Velocity Potential & its anomaly. Similarly, Figs. 
11(a) &11(b) show the mean Stream Function & its anomaly at 850 hPa level. Negative values are 
indicated by dashed lines. Anomaly in velocity potential at 250 hPa level was negative throughout the 
country, except eastern parts of peninsula. Anomaly in the stream function at 850 hPa level was 
positive throughout the country. 
 
Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR): 
 
OLR anomaly (W/m2) over the Indian region and neighbourhood is shown in Fig. 12. OLR 
anomaly was negative over entire country and both the adjoining seas, except some pockets over 
Coastal Andhra Pradesh and eastern part of Bay of Bengal. OLR anomaly was less than -10 W/m2 over 
most parts of the region. 
  
Temperature: 
 
 
Mean seasonal maximum and minimum temperature anomaly is shown in Figs. 13(a) & 13(b) 
respectively. Maximum temperature was above normal over most parts of the country, except some 
parts of northwest India, central India and east India.  Maximum temperature anomaly was more than 
2oC over parts of Ladakh state, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Assam & Meghalaya, Andhra Pradesh 
state and South Interior Karnataka. Maximum temperature anomaly was less than -1oC over parts of 
Punjab, Rajasthan state, Uttar Pradesh state, Madhya Pradesh state and Gangatic West Bengal. 
 
Minimum temperature was above normal over most parts of the country, except some parts of 
northwest India and central India.  Minimum temperature anomaly was more than 3oC over parts of 
Punjab, Bihar, Jharkhand, Manipur, Gujarat region, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry & Karaikal and South 
Interior Karnataka.  Minimum temperature anomaly was less than -1oC over parts of West Uttar
