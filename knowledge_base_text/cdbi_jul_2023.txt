Standardized Precipitation Index: 
 
The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is an index used for monitoring drought and is 
based only on precipitation. This index is negative for dry, and positive for wet conditions. As the dry or 
wet conditions become more severe, the index becomes more negative or positive. Fig 8 (a, b, and c) 
gives the SPI values for the month of July 2023, June-July 2023 (2 months cumulative) and January 
2023 - July 2023 (7 months cumulative) respectively. 
  
 
During July, extremely wet/severely wet conditions were observed over parts of Nagaland, 
Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura, West Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, Punjab, 
Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, East Rajasthan, Gujarat state, Konkan & Goa, Marathawada, 
Vidarbha, Chattisgarh, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka state while, 
extremely dry/severely dry conditions were observed over parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam & 
Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura, Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, East 
Uttar Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Tamil Nadu. 
 
 
Cumulative past two months SPI values indicate, extremely wet/severely wet conditions over 
parts of Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura, Uttar Pradesh state, Uttarakhand, Haryana, 
Chandigarh & Delhi, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan state, West Madhya 
Pradesh, Gujarat state, Konkan & Goa, Marathawada, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil 
Nadu while, extremely dry/severely dry conditions were observed over parts of Arunachal Pradesh, 
Assam & Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura, Gangetic West Bengal, Odisha, 
Jharkhand, Bihar, East Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Maharashtra, Chattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and 
Lakshadweep. 
 
 
Cumulative SPI values of the seven months indicate, extremely wet/severely wet conditions

Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan state, Madhya Pradesh state, 
Gujarat state, Konkan & Goa, Marathawada, Vidarbha, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil 
Nadu and North Interior Karnataka while, extremely dry/severely dry conditions were observed over 
parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura, Gangetic 
West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, East Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Maharashtra, Chattisgarh and Kerala. 
 
Pressure & Wind:  
 
Figs. 9(a) and 9(b) show the mean sea level pressure & its anomaly respectively. The pressure 
anomaly was positive over most parts of the country, except over parts of central parts of south 
peninsula. It was more than 1.5 hPa over northern and northeastern parts.  
Figs. 10(a) & 10(b), 11(a) & 11(b) and 12(a) & 12(b) show the mean circulation pattern and its 
anomaly at 850, 500 & 250 hPa levels respectively. An anomalous trough was observed over south 
peninsula and adjoining Bay of Bengal at 850,500 and 250 hPa levels. 
 
Velocity Potential & Stream Function: 
 
Figs. 13(a) and 13(b) show the 250 hPa mean Velocity Potential & its anomaly for the month of 
June 2023. Similarly, Figs. 14(a) and 14(b) show the mean stream function & its anomaly at 850 hPa 
level. Anomaly in the velocity potential at 250 hPa level was negative throughout the country and 
anomaly in the stream function at 850 hPa level was negative over south peninsula and positive over 
remaining parts. 
 
 
 
6 
 
Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR): 
 
 
OLR anomaly (W/m2) over the Indian region and neighbourhood is shown in Fig 15. OLR 
anomaly was negative over most parts of the country, except east and northeastern parts. OLR 
anomaly was within ±10 W/m2 over most of the parts. Negative OLR anomaly less than -20 W/m2 was 
observed over some part of east central India and eastern parts of peninsula. 
 
Temperature: 
 
Mean monthly maximum and minimum temperature anomaly is shown in Figs. 16(a) and 16(b) 
respectively. Maximum temperature was above normal over most parts of the country, except some 
parts of northwest India, westcentral India and South Peninsular India. Maximum temperature anomaly 
was more than 2oC over parts of Bihar, Sub Himalayan West Bengal, Assam & Meghalaya, Arunachal 
Pradesh, Mizoram, Tripura, Kerala & Mahe and South Interior Karnataka. Maximum temperature 
anomaly was less than -2oC over parts of Punjab and west Rajasthan. 
 
Minimum temperature was above normal over most parts of the country, except some parts of 
northwest India, northeast India, western parts of central India and South Peninsular India.  Minimum 
temperature anomaly was more than 2oC over parts of West Bengal state, Sikkim state, Jharkhand, and 
east Madhya Pradesh.   
 
Percentage of Warm Days /Cold Nights:  
 
Fig 17(a) and 17(b) show the percentage of days when maximum (minimum) temperature was 
more (less) than 90th (10th) percentile. 
Over parts of Bihar, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura and 
South Interior Karnataka maximum temperature was greater than 90th percentile for more than 50 % of 
the days of the month. Over parts of South Interior Karnataka and Marathawada minimum temperature 
was less than 10th percentile for more than 50% of the days of the month. 
 
Fig.18 shows the mean temperature time series for the country as a whole for July since 1971. 
Five year moving average values are also shown. The mean temperature for the month this year over 
the country as a whole was 28.40oC with an anomaly of 0.43oC and the 7th highest since 1901.  Over 
East & Northeast India the mean temperature was the 2nd highest (29.38ºC with an anomaly of 1.45ºC) 
after the year 2022(29.45ºC with an anomaly of 1.52ºC) since 1901. Over South Peninsular India the 
mean temperature was the 9th highest (28.31ºC with an anomaly of 0.44ºC) since 1901. 
 
Fig. 19(a) and 19(b) show the maximum and minimum temperature series respectively for the 
country as a whole and the four homogeneous regions during July 2023 since 1971. Both the maximum 
and minimum temperature were above normal over all the homogeneous regions except Northwest 
India, where the maximum temperature was below normal.   Over East & Northeast India the maximum 
temperature was the 2nd highest (33.23ºC with an anomaly of 1.78ºC) after the year 2022(33.59ºC with

temperature was the 7th highest (25.06ºC with an anomaly of 0.52ºC) since 1901.  
  
Over the country as a whole the maximum temperature was the 16th highest (31.91ºC with an 
anomaly of 0.29ºC) and the minimum temperature was the 2nd highest (24.90ºC with an anomaly of 
0.57ºC) since 1901. 
  
  Table 3 shows temperature anomalies for the month over all India and all the four 
homogeneous regions.

Low Pressure Systems: 
 
During July 2023 one depression and four low pressure areas formed. Out of these four low 
pressure areas one low pressure area formed over Land during 10 - 11 Jul, three low pressure areas 
over Bay [ 2 low pressure areas (during 16 - 17 Jul, 20 - 22 Jul) and 1 well marked low pressure area 
during 25 - 28 Jul ]. The last low pressure area that formed over Bay on 29th July intensified into deep 
depression on 1st August which became less marked on 3rd August. Track of the system is given in the 
following table. Fig. 21 shows track of the system.

SST anomaly over the Indian & Pacific Ocean: 
 
 
Fig. 22 shows the anomaly in sea surface temperature over the tropical Indian and Pacific 
Oceans. During July 2023, positive SSTs were observed over most of the equatorial Pacific Ocean 
Positive SST anomalies were observed over the Indian Ocean, especially over north Arabian Sea. In 
the south Indian Ocean, positive SST anomalies are observed over the western part whereas negative 
SST anomalies are observed over the eastern part. 
 
SOI and Pacific SST Index: 
 
SOI (Table 4) was negative (-0.4) during the month. Sea surface temperature anomalies were 
above normal by about 1º Cover all the NINO regions. 
 
Fig. 23 shows the Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecast System (MMCFS) model output forecast 
for ENSO conditions for the coming seasons. Currently, El Niño conditions are prevailing over 
equatorial Pacific and the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are above average over most of the 
equatorial Pacific Ocean. The latest MMCFS forecast indicates El Niño conditions are likely to continue 
up to the first quarter of next year.
