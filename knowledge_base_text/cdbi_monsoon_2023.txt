Onset, Advance, and Withdrawal of Southwest Monsoon: 
 
Fig. 1(a) depicts the isochrones of the advance of the southwest monsoon and Fig. 1(b) depicts 
the isochrones of withdrawal of the southwest monsoon. The advance of the Southwest Monsoon 
began on May 19th in the southeast Bay of Bengal, Nicobar Islands, and south Andaman Sea. By May 
30th, it had extended its reach to the southwest Bay of Bengal, more parts of the southeast Bay of 
Bengal, the Andaman Sea, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and portions of the east-central Bay of 
Bengal. Continuing its advance, the monsoon covered areas such as the south Arabian Sea, Maldives, 
and the Comorin region on June 1st, followed by additional parts of the south Bay of Bengal and east-
central Bay of Bengal on June 2nd. 
 
          The monsoon reached Kerala on June 8th, 7 days later than the normal date of onset over Kerala. 
From there, it progressed further, encompassing the central Arabian Sea, remaining parts of Kerala, 
portions of Karnataka, southwest Bay of Bengal, east-central Bay of Bengal, northeast Bay of Bengal, 
northwest Bay of Bengal, most of the north-eastern states, Goa, Konkan, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, 
southwest Bay of Bengal, parts of west-central Bay of Bengal, and more parts of Andhra Pradesh, 
among others, by the second week of June. On June 19th, it extended to more areas, including parts of 
Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, west-central and northwest Bay of Bengal, and parts of Gangetic West 
Bengal and Jharkhand. During the last week of June, it covered a vast expanse, including Odisha, 
Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Vidarbha, 
Haryana, north Arabian Sea, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and more. Finally, on July 2nd, it encompassed the 
remaining parts of Rajasthan, Haryana, and Punjab, effectively covering the entire country, a 
remarkable six days ahead of the usual date of July 8th.  
 
The withdrawal of the SW-monsoon 2023 began on 25th September (Fig. 1b).  
 
Rainfall Features: 
 
Most sub-divisions of the country received excess/normal rainfall except Nagaland, Manipur, 
Mizoram & Tripura, Jharkhand, Bihar, Gangetic West Bengal, East Uttar Pradesh, South Interior 
Karnataka and Kerala & Mahe. During the season, out of 36 meteorological subdivisions, 3 subdivisions 
received excess rainfall, 26 received normal rainfall and the remaining 7 subdivisions received deficient 
rainfall (Fig.2). Table 1 shows the subdivision-wise rainfall statistics (mm) for the Southwest Monsoon 
Season 2023.

Fig. 4(a) and 4(b) show the spatial pattern of rainfall received during the season and its anomaly 
(mm) respectively. Most parts of northeast India, central India, north India, west coast, and Andaman & 
Nicobar Islands received more than 1000 mm rainfall. Parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam & 
Meghalaya, Sub Himalayan West Bengal & Sikkim, the entire west coast, and Andaman & Nicobar 
Islands received more than 2000 mm of rainfall. Parts of Assam & Meghalaya, Andaman & Nicobar 
Islands, and the west coast received more than 3000 mm of rainfall. 
 
Positive rainfall anomaly of more than 300 mm was observed over Assam & Meghalaya, 
Uttarakhand, West Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Saurashtra & Kutch, West Rajasthan, Konkan & 
Goa, Telangana and Andaman & Nicobar Islands. The magnitude of negative rainfall anomaly was 
more than 300 mm over parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, 
Mizoram & Tripura, Gangetic West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, East Uttar Pradesh, West Rajasthan, 
South Interior Karnataka, Coastal Karnataka and Kerala & Mahe. 
 
Fig. 5 shows the daily area-weight averaged rainfall (in mm) and its long-term normal over the 
country as a whole and the four homogeneous regions during the season. For the country as a whole, 
the average rainfall was above or near normal on 10 days during June, 19 days during July, 4 days 
during August, and 18 days during September. 
 
On almost 13 occasions including the continuous periods of 7 - 9 July, 8 - 9 September, and 15 
-17 September it was more than one and a half times its normal value. It was below normal at a stretch 
on 2-16 June, 20-24 June, 4 – 18 August, 24 August – 6 September, and 26 - 29 September. 
 
Fig. 6 shows the area weight averaged weekly and cumulative rainfall percentage departure 
respectively for the country as a whole during the season. Of the seventeen weeks of monsoon season, 
rainfall was above normal (>+10%) on seven occasions, below normal (<-10%) on seven occasions, 
and near normal on three occasions. Cumulative rainfall departure was negative during June, Aug, and 
September and was positive during July. The area-weight averaged rainfall for the monsoon 
season for All India this year was 94.4% of its LPA value. 
 
The realized rainfall for the season this year was 101% of its LPA over northwest India, 100 % 
of its LPA over central India, 81% of its LPA over east & northeast India, and 92% of its LPA over south 
peninsula.

Fig. 7 shows area weighted rainfall series for the monsoon season over all India and four 
homogeneous regions since 1951. 
 
Standardized Precipitation Index: 
 
The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is an index used for monitoring drought and is based 
only on precipitation. This index is negative for dry and positive for wet conditions. As the dry or wet 
conditions become more severe, the index becomes more negative or positive. Fig 8 (a & b) give the 
SPI values for the monsoon season (four months) and the year since January 2023 (nine months) 
respectively. Cumulative past four months' SPI values indicate, extremely wet/severely wet conditions 
over parts of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura, West Uttar Pradesh, 
Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, West Madhya Pradesh, Saurashtra & 
Kutch, Chhattisgarh, and Tamil Nadu & Karaikal while, extremely dry/severely dry conditions were 
observed over parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & 
Tripura, Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh state, Madhya Maharashtra, 
Chhattisgarh, South Interior Karnataka, and Kerala & Mahe.  
 
 
Cumulative SPI values of the nine months indicate, extremely wet/severely wet conditions over 
parts of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Uttar Pradesh state, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, 
Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan state, West Madhya Pradesh, Saurashtra & Kutch, Chhattisgarh, Andhra 
Pradesh state, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu & Karaikal while, extremely dry/severely dry conditions 
were observed over parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & 
Tripura, Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, East Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Maharashtra, 
Chhattisgarh, Coastal Karnataka, South Interior Karnataka and Kerala & Mahe.

anomaly was positive over most parts of the country, except the northern parts of the south peninsula 
and extreme northeastern parts. Pressure anomaly was within range ± 1.5 hPa over most parts of the 
country. Pressure anomaly was more than 1.5 hPa over extreme northeastern parts, central parts, and 
extreme northern parts. 
 
Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), 11(a) and 11(b) and 12(a) and 12(b) show the mean circulation pattern 
and its anomalies at 850, 500, and 250 hPa levels respectively. At 850 hPa level, anomalous low level 
jet was observed. At 500 hPa level,an anomalous anti cyclonic circulation was oberved over South 
Arabian Sea. At 250 hPA level, anomalous easterlies were observed over northern parts of India. 
 
Velocity Potential & Stream Function: 
 
Figs. 13(a) and 13(b) show the 250 hPa mean Velocity Potential & its anomaly respectively. 
Similarly, Figs. 14(a) and 14(b) show the mean Stream Function & its anomalies at 850 hPa level 
respectively. Negative values are indicated by dashed lines. Anomaly in the Velocity Potential at 250 
hPa level was positive (divergence) throughout the country and anomaly in the Stream Function at 850 
hPa level was positive over most parts except the extreme south peninsula. 
 
Outgoing Long Wave Radiation (OLR): 
 
 
OLR anomaly (W/m2) over the Indian region and neighbourhood is shown in Fig 15. OLR 
anomaly was negative throughout the country, except in extreme northern, east & northeastern parts, 
northern parts of the Bay, and southern parts of the Arabian Sea. OLR anomaly was within the normal 
range ± 10 W/m2. OLR anomaly was less than -20 W/m2 over parts of West Rajasthan.
