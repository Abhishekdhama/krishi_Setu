Standardized Precipitation Index: 
The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is an index used for monitoring drought and is based 
on only precipitation.  This index is negative for dry, and positive for wet conditions. As the dry or wet 
conditions become more severe, the index becomes more negative or positive. Fig 5 (a & b) give the 
SPI values for the Pre-monsoon season this year and for the period from past monsoon season i.e. 
June 2022-May 2023 (12 months cumulative) respectively.  
 
 
Cumulative SPI values of the past three months show extremely wet/severely wet conditions 
over parts of Odisha, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh state, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, 
Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan state, Madhya Pradesh state, Gujarat state, Madhya 
Maharashtra, Marathawada, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh state, Telangana, 
Tamilnadu, Puducherry & Karaikal  and North Interior Karnataka while, extremely dry/severely dry 
conditions were observed over parts of A & N Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, 
Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura and Kerala & Mahe. 
 
 
Cumulative SPI values of the past twelve months indicate that extremely wet/severely wet 
conditions were observed over parts of Sub Himalayan West Bengal & Sikkim, Odisha, Uttar 
Pradesh state, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan state, Madhya 
Pradesh state, Gujarat Region, Madhya Maharashtra, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, 
Rayalaseema, Tamilnadu, Puducherry & Karaikal, North Interior Karnataka and South Interior 
Karnataka while, extremely dry/severely dry conditions were observed over parts of A & N Islands, 
Arunachal Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura, Sub Himalayan 
5 
 
West Bengal & Sikkim, Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, East Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, 
Chandigarh & Delhi and Chhattisgarh.  
 
Pressure & Wind: 
Figs. 6(a) & 6(b) show the mean sea level pressure & its anomaly respectively. The pressure 
anomaly was positive over almost all parts of the country. The pressure anomaly was more than +1.5 
hPa over most parts of the country. The pressure anomaly was more than +3.0 hPa over east central 
India and northern India. 
Figs. 7(a) & 7(b), 8(a) & 8(b) and 9(a) & 9(b) shows the mean circulation pattern and its 
anomaly at 850, 500 & 250 hPa levels respectively. At 850 hPa level, an anomalous anti cyclonic 
circulation was seen over central parts of Bay of Bengal and adjoining central India. At 500 hpa level, 
an anomalous trough was seen over entire country and adjoining Arabian sea. This pattern persisted at 
250 hPa level also. 
Velocity Potential & Stream Function: 
Figs. 10(a) & 10(b) show the 250 hPa mean Velocity Potential & its anomalies. Similarly, Figs. 
11(a) & 11(b) show the mean stream function & its anomalies at 850 hPa level. Negative values are 
indicated by dashed lines. Anomaly in the velocity potential at 250 hPa level was positive over most 
parts of the country except northwest and westcentral region, while anomaly in the stream function at 
850 hPa level was positive over entire country.  
Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR): 
 
OLR anomaly (W/m2) over the Indian region and neighbourhood is shown in Fig. 12. OLR 
anomaly was negative over most parts of the country. OLR anomaly was within 0 to -10 W/m2. 
Temperature: 
Mean seasonal maximum and minimum temperature anomalies are shown in Figs. 13(a) & 
13(b) respectively. Maximum temperature was below normal over most parts of the country, except 
some parts of east & northeast India, coastal parts of India and both the Islands.  Maximum 
temperature anomaly was more than 1oC over parts of Bihar, Sub Himalayan West Bengal, Arunachal 
Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Odisha, Coastal Andhra Pradesh 
& Yanam, Kerala & Mahe, Coastal Karnataka, South Interior Karnataka and both the Islands.  
Maximum temperature anomaly was less than -2oC over parts of West Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh state, 
Madhya Pradesh state, Chhattisgarh, Vidarbha, Marathwada and Telangana.  
  
Minimum temperature was below normal over most parts of the country, except some parts of 
east & northeast India, northwest India, west central India, coastal south peninsular India and Andman 
& Nicobar Island.  Minimum temperature anomaly was more than 2oC over parts of Bihar and Andman 
& Nicobar Island. Minimum temperature anomaly was less than -3oC over parts of Madhya Pradesh 
state and Vidarbha. 
 
Percentage of Warm Days/Cold Nights:  
Fig 14(a) & 14(b) show the percentage of days when maximum (minimum) temperature was 
more (less) than 90th (10th) percentile. Over parts of Kerala & Mahe maximum temperature was greater 
than 90th percentile for more than 50% of the days of the season. Minimum temperature was less than 
10th percentile for more than 50% of the days of the month over parts of North Interior Karnataka and 
West Madhya Pradesh. 
6 
 
Fig.15 shows the mean temperature for the country as a whole for the season since 1971. Five 
year moving average values are also shown. The mean temperature for the season this year was 
27.68oC with an anomaly of 0.06oC. 
 
Fig. 16(a) & 16(b) shows the maximum and minimum temperature series respectively for the 
country as a whole and the four homogeneous regions during the season since 1971. Both maximum 
and minimum temperatures were below normal over all the homogeneous regions except over East & 
Northeast India and South Peninsular India. Over the country as a whole both maximum and minimum 
temperature were normal during this season. Maximum temperature over South Peninsular India 
(34.45oC) was the 9th highest since 1901.   
 
Table 2 gives temperature anomalies over India and four homogeneous regions during the 
season. 
 
Low Pressure Systems: 
  
During the season an Extremely Severe Cyclonic storm “Mocha” formed over Bay of Bengal 
during 9th – 15th May. Fig 17 shows track of this system. 
Significant Weather Events for Pre-Monsoon Season (March-May) 2023:  
 
 
During Pre Monsoon Season, total 310 persons reportedly claimed dead, more than 320
