17 Abstract 
The report discusses the climate condition over Indian region during 
the year 2023. Notably, global temperatures soared to exceptionally 
high 
levels 
during 
this 
period 
(WMO.No.1347). 
The 
India 
Meteorological Department continuously monitors weather and 
climate over Indian region. 
  
The annual mean land surface air temperature averaged over India 
during 2023 was +0.65°C above the long-term average (Period 1981-
2010). The year 2023 was the 2nd warmest year on record since 
nationwide records commenced in 1901. However, this is lower than 
the highest warming observed over India during 2016 (anomaly of 
+0.71°C). The all India mean temperatures during the pre-monsoon 
(March to May) season was normal with an anomaly of +0.06°C while 
during other seasons, it was above normal for winter (January to 
February) season (anomaly of +0.83°C), monsoon (June to 
September) season (anomaly of +0.74°C) and post-monsoon 
(October to December) season (anomaly of +1.0°C).  Heat wave 
conditions were observed over most parts of central, northwest India 
and East and Northeast India during the months of April and June. 
   
The 2023 annual rainfall over the country as a whole was 95% of its 
Long Period Average (LPA) value for the period 1971-2020. The 
monsoon season rainfall over the country as a whole was 95% of its 
LPA. The seasonal rainfall during the Northeast monsoon season 
(October – December) over the NE Monsoon core region of the south 
peninsula was 94% of its LPA.  In 2023, there were 6 cyclones formed 
over the north Indian Ocean and other extreme weather events also 
reported many parts of the country

The annual mean land surface air temperature for the country during the year 2023 was 
+0.65°C above the 1981-2010 average, thus making the year 2023 the second warmest year on record 
since 1901 (Fig. 2). The five warmest years on record, in descending order were 2016 (+0.71°C) 
2023(+0.65°C), 2009(+0.55°C), 2017 (+0.541°C) and 2010 (+0.539°C). It may be mentioned that 12 out 
of the 15 warmest years were during the recent 15 years (2009-2023). The past decade (2013-2022 / 
2014-2023) was also the warmest decade on record with the decadal averaged annual mean 
temperature anomaly (Actual -LPA) of +0.41°C / +0.46°C. The country averaged annual mean 
temperature during 1901-2023 showed a significant increasing trend of 0.66°C / 100 years (Fig. 2). 
During the year 2023 a significant increasing trend was observed in maximum temperature (1.01°C / 
100 years) and in minimum temperature (0.31°C / 100 years). 
 
The country averaged seasonal mean temperature was normal during the pre-monsoon season 
(March-May, with an anomaly of +0.06°C), while the winter season (January- February, with an 
anomaly of +0.83°C), monsoon season (June- September, with an anomaly of +0.74°C) and post-
monsoon season (October- December, with anomaly +1.0°C) were above normal.  
 
The monthly mean temperatures for the country during 2023 was above normal for the ten 
months of the year, except for April and May (anomaly 0.1°C, -0.27°C respectively), where it was 
normal / below normal. The All India mean temperature during the month of February was second 
highest with an anomaly of +1.36°C, August was highest with an anomaly of +0.90°C, September was 
highest with an anomaly of +0.91°C, November was highest with an anomaly of +1.05°C and December 
was also highest with an anomaly of +1.52°C since 1901. The maximum temperature was the highest 
(with an anomaly of +1.86°C) and minimum temperature was the fifth highest (with an anomaly of 
+0.87°C) for the month of February since 1901. The maximum temperature was the highest (with an 
anomaly of +1.10°C) and minimum temperature was the second highest (with an anomaly of +0.69°C) 
for the month of August since 1901. The maximum temperature was second highest (with an anomaly 
of +0.86°C) and minimum temperature was highest (with an anomaly of +0.96°C) for the month of 
September since 1901. The maximum temperature was third highest (with an anomaly of +0.61°C) and 
minimum temperature was also third highest (with an anomaly of +1.48°C) for the month of November 
since 1901. The minimum temperature was the second highest (with an anomaly +0.57°C) for the 
month of July since 1901.  The maximum temperature was third highest (with an anomaly +0.93°C) for 
the month of October since 1901. The minimum temperature was highest (with an anomaly of +1.71°C) 
for the month of December since 1901.

Daily Rainfall variation during Monsoon Season: 
 
Daily area weight averaged rainfall (mm) over the country as a whole during the monsoon 
season 2023 (1st Jun. to 30th Sep.) and its long term average (1971-2020) values are shown in Fig. 
15(a). For the country as a whole, rainfall averaged was above or near normal on 10 days during June, 
19 days during July, 4 days during August and 18 days during September. 
 
On almost 13 occasions including the continuous periods of 7 - 9 July, 8 - 9 September, 15 -17 
September it was more than one and half times its normal value. It was below normal at a stretch on 1-
16 June, 20 - 24 June, 4 – 18 August, 24 August – 6 September, 26 - 29 September.

There were many extreme rainfall events observed during 2023 southwest monsoon season. 
The location of heavy and extremely heavy rainfall events during 2023 southwest monsoon season is 
given in Fig. 16(a,b). Extremely heavy rainfall events were observed in June mainly over Rajasthan 
due to the extremely severe cyclonic storm “BIPARJOY”. During July, the extremely heavy rainfall 
events were more realized over Konkan & Goa, coastal Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, 
and Telangana due to the formation of low pressure systems. In the month of August, the extremely 
heavy rainfall events were more realized over Odisha and Gangetic West Bengal due to the formation 
of one Deep depression and one low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal. Also, two western 
disturbances (WDs) caused very heavy to extremely heavy rainfalls and floods over Himachal and 
Uttarakhand mainly by triggering southerly/south-westerly winds from the Arabian Sea. During 
September, the extremely heavy rainfall events were more realized over Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and 
West Uttar Pradesh due to the formation of low pressure areas over the Bay of Bengal.

Rainfall during Post-monsoon season:  
 
 
Rainfall activity over core region of the South Peninsular India (comprising of 5 subdivisions viz. 
Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry & Karaikal, South Interior Karnataka 
and Kerala & Mahe) during the season as a whole was 94% of its LPA.

C) Standardized Precipitation Index 
The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is an index used for measuring drought and is 
based on precipitation. This index is negative for dry, and positive for wet conditions. As the dry or wet 
conditions become more severe, the index becomes more negative or positive. Fig.18 gives the district 
wise SPI values for the year 2023. 
Cumulative SPI values of January to December indicate extremely wet-severely wet conditions 
over parts of Uttar Pradesh state, Rajasthan state, West Madhya Pradesh, Saurashtra & Kutch, Coastal 
Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, A & N Islands, 
Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, while extremely dry-severely dry conditions were observed over 
parts of East Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, South Interior Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Maharashtra, 
Coastal Karnataka, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, Kerala and Nagaland, Manipur Mizoram 
& Tripura.

D) TROPICAL STORMS / DEPRESSIONS IN THE INDIAN SEAS 
 
In 2023, there were 6 cyclones formed over the north Indian Ocean. Of these, 3 were Extremely 
Severe Cyclonic Storm “MOCHA”, “BIPARJOY” & “TEJ”, Two were Severe Cyclonic Storm 
“MICHAUNG” and MIDHILI, one was Very Severe Cyclonic Storm “HAMOON”. Of these, 4 cyclones 
Viz. MOCHA, HAMOON, MIDHILI, MICHAUNG formed over the Bay of Bengal & 2 cyclones Viz. 
BIPARJOY, TEJ formed over Arabian Sea. 
 
Among these 6 cyclones, MOCHA formed in the pre-monsoon season during 9th to 15th May, 
BIPARJOY formed in the monsoon season & remaining 4 cyclones TEJ, HAMOON, MIDHILI, 
MICHAUNG formed in the post-monsoon season. 
 
During winter season, one depression formed over southeast and adjoining southwest Bay of 
Bengal which moved towards south Srilanka. 
 
During pre-monsoon season, an Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm “MOCHA” FORMED OVER 
Bay of Bengal during the period 9 - 15 May. 
 
During the monsoon season, fourteen low pressure systems (1 ESCS, 1 Deep Depression, 1 
Depressions, 5 well marked low pressure areas, 5 low pressure areas and 1 land low pressure areas) 
 
 
24 
 
were formed. The frequency and place of origin of these low pressure systems formed over the Indian 
region during the monsoon season is shown in the table below.
