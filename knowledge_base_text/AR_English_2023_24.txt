1.8     Minimum Support Price
The Government's price policy for major 
agricultural commodities seeks to ensure 
remunerative prices to the growers for their 
produce with a view to encouraging higher 
investment and production and to safeguard the 
interest of consumers by making available supplies 
at reasonable prices. Towards this end, Government 
announces Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for 
twenty-two (22) mandated crops based on the 
recommendations of the Commission for 
Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP) after 
considering the views of concerned State 
Governments and Central Ministries/Departments. 
The 22 mandated crops include 14 Kharif crops viz. 
paddy, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, arhar, moong, urad, 
groundnut, soybean (yellow), sunflower seed, 
sesamum, nigerseed, cotton and 6 Rabi crops viz. 
wheat, barley, gram, masur (lentil), rapeseed & 
mustard, safflower and two commercial crops viz. 
jute and copra. In addition to that, MSP for toria and 
de-husked coconut are also fixed on the basis of 
MSPs of rapeseed & mustard and copra, 
respectively. 
While recommending MSPs, 
considers 
CACP 
important factors like cost of production, overall 
demand-supply situation of various crops in 
domestic and world markets, domestic and 
international prices, inter-crop price parity, terms 
of trade between agricultural and non-agricultural 
sector, likely effect of price policy on rest of the 
economy and a minimum of 50 percent as the 
margin over cost of production.
The Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the 
pre-determined principle to keep MSP at levels of 
one and half times of the cost of production. 
Accordingly, Government has declared the MSPs for 
all mandated Kharif, Rabi and other commercial 
crops with a return of at least 50 per cent over all 
India weighted average cost of production from the 
agricultural year 2018-19. In line with the same 
principle, Government has announced the MSP for 
all mandated Kharif crops of year 2023-24 on 7  
th
June 2023 for all mandated Rabi crops of year 
, 
2023-24 on 18  October, 2023 MSP for Copra for

Doubling of Farmers' Income (DFI): 
Government constituted an Inter-ministerial 
Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating 
to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend 
strategies to achieve the same. The Committee 
submitted its Report to the Government in 
September, 2018 containing comprehensive 
strategy for doubling of farmers' income through 
various policies, reforms & programmes. To achieve 
the objective, the Committee identified seven 
sources of income growth:-
 
i. 
Increase in crop productivity 
 
ii. Increase in livestock productivity 
 
iii. Resource use efficiency – reduction in 
 
 
cost of production
 
iv. Increase in cropping intensity 
 
v. Diversification to high value agriculture 
 
vi. Re munerative p rices on  farmer s'  
 
 
produce 
 
vii. Shift of surplus manpower from farm to 
 
 
non-farm occupations 
2.  
In line with the strategy for increasing 
farmers' income, as suggested by the DFI 
Committee, Government has adopted various 
reforms and policies that focus on higher income for 
farmers and implemented various developmental 
schemes, programmes and initiatives aimed at 
supplementing the efforts of the State Governments 
for the welfare of farmers by modernizing and 
rationalizing use of inputs so as to decrease cost, 
increasing production, remunerative returns, 
income support, old age security, etc.  The approach 
is in consonance with the sources of growth in 
income of the farmers suggested by the DFI 
Committee. These schemes, programmes and 
initiatives include:
 
i. 
Income support to farmers through PM 
  
KISAN  
 ii. 
Pr ad h an  M an tr iFa s al Bi m aYoj an a   
  
(PMFBY)    
 
iii.

3.     All these policies & programmes are being 
supported by higher budgetary allocations of 
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.  In 
the Fiscal year 2013-14, when the Ministry of 
Cooperation, Department of Animal Husbandry and 
Dairying, and Department of Fisheries were 
integral parts of the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Farmers Welfare, the total budget allocation was a 
mere Rs. 30,223.88 crore. Despite the subsequent 
separation of these ministries/ departments, the 
total budget allocation for the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has witnessed a 
substantial increase, reaching Rs.1,25,035.79 crore 
(Rs. 1,15,531.79 crore for DA&FW and Rs. 9,504 
crore for DARE) in the financial year 2023-24. 
Budgetary allocations for other line Departments / 
Ministries, non-budgetary financial resources such 
as creating Corpus Funds like Micro Irrigation Fund, 
Agriculture Infrastructure Funds, PM Matasya 
Sampada Yojana, Animal Husbandry Infrastructure 
Development Fund, etc. Further, due to 
implementation of these schemes, programmes and 
initiatives, there has been record production in

1.10 Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan 
Abhiyan” (PM-AASHA) 
Investment and Price Support Division of this 
Department implements umbrella scheme of 
Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan 
Abhiyan” (PM-AASHA) comprising Price Support 
Schee (PSS), Price Deficiency Payment Scheme 
(PDPS) and Private Procurement and Stockist 
Scheme (PPSS). Under PM-AASHA, States / UTs are 
offered to choose either PSS and PDPS in a given 
procurement season with respect to particular 
oilseeds crop for the entire State. The pulses and 
copra are procured under PSS. Only one scheme i.e. 
PSS or PDPS is made operational in one State with 
respect to one commodity. Further, States have the 
option to roll out Private Procurement and Stockist 
Scheme (PPSS) on pilot basis in district / selected 
APMC(s) of district involving the participation of 
private stockist for oilseed. The brief of PSS,PDPS 
and PPSS are as under:-
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
15
(I)
PSS:-
       
 This scheme is implemented at the 
request of the concerned State Govt. which agrees to 
exempt the procured commodities from levy of 
mandi tax and assist central nodal agencies, in 
logistic arrangements, including gunny bags, 
working capital for state agencies, creation of 
revolving fund for PSS operations, etc. as required 
under the scheme guidelines. Procurement of these 
commodities are undertaken by Central Nodal 
agencies at Minimum Support Price (MSP) 
announced by the Govt. as and when prices fall 
below the MSP and as well as compliance of State 
Govt. to PSS guidelines. The procurement details of 
pulses, oilseeds & copra  procured at MSP under PSS 
since 2018-19 are enclosed at Annexure-1.1
(ii)  
PDPS:- This scheme envisages direct 
payment of the difference between the MSP and the 
selling / modal price to pre- registered farmers 
selling their produce in the notified market yard 
through a transparent auction process. All the 
payments will be transferred directly into bank 
account of farmers. This scheme does not involve 
any physical procurement of crops as the farmers 
are paid the difference between the MSP and Sale / 
Modal price on sale in notified market.
(iii)  
PPSS:-  In addition to PDPS, oilseed 
producing States will have the option to roll out 
Private Procurement Stockist Scheme (PPSS) on 
pilot basis in district/ selected APMC(s) of district 
involving the participation of private stockist. The 
pilot district/ selected APMC(s) of district will cover 
one or more crop of oilseeds for which MSP is 
notified. Since this is akin to PSS, it involves physical 
procurement of the notified commodity.
2. 
This Section also implements Market 
Intervention Scheme (MIS) for procurement of 
agricultural/horticultural commodities, which are 
perishable in nature and for which MSP is not 
notified by the Central Government. The objective of 
intervention is to protect the growers of these 
commodities from making distress sale in the event 
of a bumper crop during the peak arrival period 
when the prices tend to fall below economic levels 
and cost of production. The condition for 
implementation of MIS is that there should be either 
at least a 10 percent increase in production or a 10 
percent decrease in the ruling market prices over 
the previous normal year. The scheme is 
implemented at the request of a State/UT 
government which is ready to bear 50 percent of the 
loss (25 percent in case of North-Eastern States), if 
any, incurred on its implementation. The extent of 
total  am ount o f los s in cu rred  by the 
implementation agency is restricted to 25 percent 
of the total procurement value which includes cost 
of the commodity procured plus permitted 
overhead expenses. Details of sanction accorded 
under MIS since 2018-19 are enclosed at 
Annexure-1.2.
1.11  Agriculture Credit 
The performance of the agriculture sector remains 
critical to growth and employment in the country. 
Investment in the sector must be encouraged 
through an affordable, timely and inclusive 
approach to credit delivery. In this regard, the 
government announces an annual target for 
Agriculture Credit in the budget annually. 
Agricultural credit flow has shown consistent 
progress every year. The agriculture credit flow 
target for the year 2022-23 was fixed at Rs. 
18,50,000 crore, and against this target, the 
achievement was Rs. 21,87,413 crore. The 
agriculture credit flow target for 2023-24 has been 
fixed at Rs. 20,00,000 crore.
1.12
Modified Interest Subvention Scheme 
 
(MISS)
To ensure that the farmers pay a minimal interest 
rate to the banks, the department has introduced the 
Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS), now renamed 
Modified Interest Subvention Scheme (MISS), to 
provide short-term Agri-loans to farmers at 
concessional interest rates. Under the scheme, 
farmers are given an upfront interest subvention of 
1.5%. Therefore, short-term crop loans up to Rs. 3.00 
lakh are available to farmers engaged in agriculture 
and other allied activities at an interest rate of 7%. An 
additional 3% prompt repayment incentive (PRI) is 
also given to the farmers for prompt and timely 
repayment of loans; thus, the effective interest rate 
comes down to 4% per annum.
1.13 
 Kisan Credit Card (KCC)
Safeguarding and ensuring hassle-free credit 
availability at a cheaper rate to farmers has been the 
top priority of this department. Accordingly, the 
Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC) was introduced for 
farmers to provide farmers with easy access to 
Annual Report 2023-24
16
affordable credit for their agricultural needs so as to 
meet short term/long term cultivation 
requirements, postharvest expenses, consumption 
requirement etc. The KCC aims at providing 
adequate and timely credit support from the 
banking systems to the farmers for their cultivation 
and other needs like post-harvest expense; provide 
marketing loan; consumption requirement of 
farmers' household; working capital for 
maintenance of farm assets and activities allied to 
agriculture; investment credit requirement for 
agriculture and allied activities. In addition, KCC is 
also available for agriculture and allied activities 
like Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries etc. 
1.14  
Kisan Rin Portal (KRP)
The portal has been developed by this department 
and helps farmers avail of subsidised loans under 
the KCC. It offers a comprehensive view of farmer 
data, loan disbursement specifics, interest 
subvention claims, and scheme utilisation progress. 
It fosters seamless integration with banks for more 
focused and efficient agriculture credit.
1.15  Commission for Agricultural Costs and 
Prices 
The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices 
(CACP) was set up with a view to evolve a balanced 
and integrated price structure, is mandated to 
advice on the price policy of 23 crops. These include 
Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for 22 crops i.e. 
seven cereal crops (paddy, wheat, jowar, bajra, 
maize, ragi and barley), five pulses (gram, tur, 
moong, urad and lentil), seven oilseeds (groundnut, 
sunflower seed, soybean, rapeseed mustard, 
safflower, niger seed and sesamum), copra (dried 
coconut), cotton, raw jute and Fair and 
Remunerative Prices (FRP) for sugarcane. CACP 
submits its recommendations to the government in 
the form of Price Policy Reports every year, 
separately for five groups of commodities namely 
Kharif crops, Rabi crops, Sugarcane, Raw Jute and 
Copra. Before preparing these five price policy 
reports, the Commission seeks views of various 
Central Ministries, State Governments, Farmers, 
Farmers Association, Research Institutes and other 
stakeholders. 
 Determinants of MSP 
Cost of production (CoP) is one of the important 
factors in the determination of MSP of mandated 
crops. Besides cost, the Commission considers other 
important factors such as demand and supply, price 
trends in the domestic and international markets, 
intercrop price parity, the likely effect of the price 
policy on the rest of the economy, rational utilization 
of land, water and other production resources, and a 
minimum of 50 percent as the margin over the cost of 
production in case of MSPs and reasonable margin 
over cost of production in case of FRP.

Overview
3.1 
Economics, Statistics and Evaluation 
Division, previously known as Directorate of 
Economics & Statistics (DES) erstwhile an attached 
office of DAC&FW , is mandated to support work of 
the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare 
through quality data and analysis towards 
appropriate policy formulation and execution of 
schemes in the interest of farmers and consumers. 
The Division is mandated to build and maintain a 
strong database in partnership with the States on 
area, production, yield of Principal crops and cost of 
production of mandated crops to arrive at Minimum 
Support Price. Economics, Statistics & Evaluation 
Division collects price data through its regional 
offices and regularly analyses the same to identify 
trigger points for policy intervention towards stable 
food prices. ESE Division is the knowledge bank of the 
Ministry that places a large volume of data and 
information in the public domain for multiple 
stakeholders, and carries out Agro-Economic 
Research / Studies in the field of agriculture. In 
addition, the Division coordinates with international 
bodies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO) on global effort to improve agricultural 
statistics. It is responsible for providing necessary 
data of the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for GDP 
compilation and also meets international obligation 
related to standards of data dissemination.
3.2  
Major Programmes/Activities
3.2.1  Agricultural Statistics Division
The Agricultural Statistics (AS) Section, (ESE 
Division) within the Department of Agriculture and 
Farmers' Welfare releases a series of four crop 
production estimates for 28 major agricultural 
crops, which include rice, wheat, coarse cereals, 
pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton, Jute & Mesta. 
These estimates are available at both the state and 
national levels. 
The First Advance Estimates (AEs) focuses on kharif 
crops only, which is released in October, once the 
kharif sowing season has concluded. Second 
Advance Estimates covering both kharif and rabi 
crops, are usually published in February of the 
following year, coinciding with the end of the rabi 
sowing period. Third Advance Estimates released in 
May, incorporates revised data on rabi crop acreage 
and more precise yield estimates for kharif crops. 
Additionally, they include estimates for summer 
crops. Final Estimates are typically released in 
September / October. At this point, states are 
expected to have provided comprehensive data on 
both kharif, rabi and summer crop area and yields.
When compiling the All-India level estimates, the 
data on crop area, production, and yield received 
from State Governments undergo a rigorous 
validation process. This validation is based on 
information obtained from various alternative 
sources, such as remote sensing based forecast from 
the Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre 
(MNCFC), Econometric modeling based crop 
forecast provided by the Institute of Economics 
Growth (IEG), inputs received from the weekly Crop 
Weather Watch Group (CWWG) meetings, previous 
trends in area, production and yield, yield 
expectation information received through Farmers 
Survey and yield data received through supervised 
CCE sample yield of NSSO.
Unified Portal for Agricultural Statistics (UPAg) is an 
advanced agricultural data management platform 
designed to generate crop estimates and integrate 
with other systems generating Agriculture Statistics 
such as price, trade, procurement, stock etc. It serves 
as a centralized hub for near real time information on 
crop production, market trends, pricing, and other 
vital agricultural data.
Improvement of Agricultural Statistics (IAS) is a 
component of Agriculture Economics & Statistics 
categorized under “Other Central Expenditure” 
under which 100% financial Assistance is given to 
States/UTs for payment of salaries, travel expenses, 
21
honorarium etc. by the Central Govt. The basic 
objective of Improvement of Agricultural Statistics 
is to collect and improve agricultural statistics such 
as area/yield/production of principal agricultural 
crops. Improvement of Agricultural Statistics (IAS) 
has three sub components; (i) Timely Reporting 
Scheme (TRS), (ii) Improvement of Crop Statistics 
(ICS) and (iii) Establishment of an Agency for 
Reporting of Agricultural Statistics (EARAS). The 
sub component-wise details of the scheme are as 
under: - 
Timely Reporting Scheme (TRS): The objective of 
TRS is to obtain estimates of area under principal 
crops in each season, with the breakup of area 
under irrigated/unirrigated and traditional/high 
yielding varieties of crops on the basis of random 
sample of 20% of villages by a specific date. These 
estimates are used for generating advance 
estimates of production of principal crops. This 
component is being implemented in 16 land record 
States and Union Territories of Delhi, Jammu & 
Kashmir and Puducherry. 
Improvement of Crop Statistics (ICS): The objective 
of ICS is to improve the quality of statistics on area 
and production of crops through supervision and 
monitoring. Under this sub component, a sample 
check of area enumeration of 10,000 villages and 
approximately 30,000 crop cutting experiments at 
harvest stage are undertaken. These sample checks 
are equally shared by the Central Agency i.e., 
National Sample Survey Office; and the State 
Agricultural Authorities. These checks specifically 
relate to (a) Enumeration of crop-wise area covered 
in the selected villages as recorded by the Patwari; 
(b) Total Area under each crop recorded in Khasra 
Register of villages; and (c) Supervision of Crop 
Cutting Experiments at the harvest stage. The IAS 
scheme is being implemented in 25 TRS/EARAS 
states and the Union Territory of Delhi, Jammu & 
Kashmir and Puducherry. The performance of the 
implementation of ICS component is also being 
closely monitored through Quarterly and Seasonal 
progress Reports.  
Establishment of an Agency for Reporting of 
Agricultural Statistics (EARAS): This sub Component 
is being implemented in the permanently settled 
States of Kerala, Odisha and West Bengal and North 
Eastern States of Nagaland, Sikkim, Arunachal 
Pradesh and Tripura. Under EARAS sub component, 
an agency has been established in these states for 
generating estimates of area and Production of 
principal crops and land use statistics, on the basis of 
complete enumeration of 20% villages in each year. 
The performance of the implementation of the 
component is being closely monitored through 
Quarterly and Seasonal progress Reports.
During the financial year 2023-24 under 
Improvement of Agricultural Statistics Scheme 
against total allocation of Rs. 109.05 Crores (BE), Rs. 
76.69 Crores have been released till 31  December, 
st
2023
 
Activities Undertaken for Welfare of Women 
and North- Eastern State- Main objective of 
the component is to collect and compile 
agricultural statistics and it is not a welfare-
oriented programme, no specific activity 
either for women or for the North-eastern 
States are undertaken under the scheme. 
However, in North Eastern States (NES), the 
scheme is in operation in Arunachal Pradesh, 
Assam, Nagaland, Sikkim & Tripura. During 
the financial year 2023-24, Rs. 7.96 Crore (up 
to 31.12.2023) have been released to NES 
under the Scheme.
 
Two Day Training Programme on Mobile 
Application & Web Portal for General Crop 
Estimation Survey (GCES)- Economics, 
Statistics & Evaluation Division (ES&ED) has 
developed mobile application & web portal 
for recording Crop Cutting Experiments 
(CCEs) conducted under the general crop 
estimation survey (GCES) and generation of 
yield estimation in order to digitise the Crop 
Cutting Experiments (CCEs) GCES. The Web 
Portal & Mobile Application were official 
launched by Secretary (DA&FW)  on 
21.09.2023. Since the pilot rollout of the 
application was scheduled for ongoing kharif 
season 2023-24 in few selected states, a two 
days training programme of masters trainers 
nominated by sates Government was 
organised on 05.10.2023 and 06.10.2023 in 
Lecture Hall, NASC Complex, Pusa New Delhi.

3.2.2   Cost Study Section:
The Cost of Cultivation of principal crops in India is 
being implemented in India since 1970-71. The 
main objectives of the component are to collect and 
compile data on cost of cultivation and production 
in respect of principal crops and to generate crop-
wise and State-wise cost of cultivation and 
production estimates of mandated crops.
1.  
Comprehensive cost statistics in respect of 
Principal crops are collected through 19 
Agricultural/Central/General Universities 
located in different States; cost of cultivation 
data is transmitted to the CACP so as to enable 
them to recommend the MSPs of the 
mandated crops with regard to Kharif and 
Rabi Seasons.
2.  
The cost estimates generated under the 
Schemes are also used for research purposed 
and policy formulations by the Central 
Ministries a nd State Govern ments, 
A gri c ultu ral/ Ge ne ral U n ive rs itie s, 
Government/Non-government Research 
Organizations, Individual researchers (both at 
domestic and international levels) etc.
4.  
The Scheme is implemented in 19 states 
namely Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, 
Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal 
Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, 
Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, 
Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, 
Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. 
5.  
During the block period 2023-24 to 2025-26, 
the schemes covers 25 principal crops, i.e., 
paddy, wheat, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, barley, 
moong, urad, arhar, gram, lentil, groundnut, 
rapeseed and mustard, nigerseed, safflower, 
soybean, sunflower, sesamum, cotton, jute, 
sugarcane, onion, potato, and coconut. The 
combination of crops covered in each state 
(also known as crop complex) varies from state 
to state depending upon their importance in 
terms of its relative contribution in the 
production of the relevant crop at all-India 
level.
6.  
The field data are collected on the basis of Cost 
Accounting Method by the 19 State 
Implementing Agencies. Under the Scheme, 
daily entries of debit/credit for expenditure/ 
income are made in order to assess the total 
cost/benefit incurred/accrued to each farmer. 
The field data is collected through a detailed 
questionnaire administered by field staff 
through direct interaction with the sample 
farmers of 06 selected farm holdings as per 
the sampling design in each village. Six 
operational holdings in a village consist of 2 
each from 3 different size classes, viz., 0 to 1 
hectare, 1-2 hectare, 2 and above.
7.   
In the financial year 2022-23, 195 cost 
estimates were generated and provided to 
CACP. Out of 195 estimates, 45 for Rabi, 122 for 
Kharif, 07 for Onion, 07 for Potato, 07 for 
Sugarcane, 03 for Jute and 04 for Coconut were 
generated in respect of 25 mandated crops.  
3.2.3 Food Economics Section :
FE Section examines price policy reports of Kharif 
crops, Rabi crops, Copra and Raw Jute recommended 
by CACP considering the views of concerned State 
Governments and Central Ministries/Departments 
and other relevant factors which are considered 
important for fixation of MSP and submits the note 
for consideration of Cabinet Committee on Economic 
Affairs (CCEA) for declaration of MSP of these crops. 
In addition, the Section is involved in declaration of 
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
23
the MSP of Toria based on price differentials of toria 
and rapeseed/ mustard. 
3.2.4 Special Data Dissemination Standards 
(SDDS) Section
The Section is involved in collection and compilation 
of data relating to nine-fold classification of land, 
irrigated area (source-wise and crop-wise) and total 
area under crops for States and UTs. The compiled 
statistics is brought out in the publications 'Land Use 
Statistics' and 'Agricultural Statistics at a Glance'. The 
compiled data on Land Use Statistics (District wise 
and State-wise) from 1998-99 onwards are available 
on the website. The district wise compiled data on 
Area, Production and Yield (APY) and Land Use 
Statistics (LUS) from 1998-99 onwards are also 
available on the website 'data.desagri.gov.in'. The 
Division also generates quarterly estimates of 
agricultural production for use in the compilation of 
quarterly National Accounts by the National 
Statistical Office. This activity was undertaken in 
order to meet the obligations concerning supply of 
data to the International Monetary Fund. In the 
absence of direct data, quarterly production is 
estimated by using the estimates of Kharif and Rabi 
seasons in conjunction with the crop calendar.

There are Twelve (12) ﬁeld level Market Intelligence 
Units (MIUs) with Kolkata MIU having additional 
charge of Shillong MIU, located across  India reporting 
to this section which play major role in data collection. 
A Working Group was constituted by DPIIT for the 
revision of base year of WPI series (base 2011-12), 
under the chairmanship of Shri.  Ramesh Chand 
(Member, NITI Aayog).Based on the recommendation 
of Working group for the revision of Base Year of WPI 
series (base 2011-12), some new commodities have 
been added and the number of quotations have also 
increased. The Department has discontinued collating 
retail prices of agricultural commodities w.e.f 
01.04.2023 to avoid duplication as retail prices are 
collected by other concerned Ministries.
This Section also compiles data on farm harvest 
prices of 35 principal crops from 30 States / Union 
Territories. Two annual publications “Agricultural 
Prices in India” and “Farm Harvest Prices of 
Principal Crops in India” are brought out by this 
section every year.
Index of Terms of Trade (TOT) of farmers and 
agricultural Sectors is also prepared on annual basis 
as per the methodology recommended by the  
Working Group headed by Prof. S. Mahendra Dev, 
the then Director, Indira Gandhi     Institute of 
Development Research (IGIDR), Mumbai. This 
Index is to be  used as an input for price policy 
formulation of agricultural crops by Commission for 
Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).
The Agricultural Market Information System 
(AMIS), hosted by Food & Agriculture Organization 
of United Nations, is an inter-agency platform  
launched in 2011 by the G20 Ministers of 
Agriculture, to enhance food market transparency 
and policy response for food security. AMIS consists 
of Global Food Market Information Group and Rapid 
Response Forum to get timely market update and 
policy discussion. Department of   Agriculture and 
Farmers Welfare, participated in 12th Session of the 
Agricultural Marketing Information System (AMIS), 
Rapid Response Forum held on 29 March 2023 in 
Chandigarh as part of the country's G20 Presidency. 
The Department has also participated in the Global 
Food Market Information Group meeting held in 
June 2023. AMIS-FAO prepares Food  Balance Sheet, 
where data on inputs of production, food, feed; seed 
use  and trade of 4 agricultural commodities, i.e. 
wheat, rice, maize and Soyabean are maintained 
globally. As per government directive, Prices & 
Market Section provides the required data to AMIS-
 
FAO at regular intervals and coordinates the policy 
discussions.

Meteorology and Land Based Observations 
(FASAL)” project through partner organizations i.e. 
Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre 
(MNCFC), New Delhi, India Metrological 
Department (IMD), New Delhi and Institute of 
Economic Growth (IEG), New Delhi. 
Besides, the Section is also involved in organization of 
weekly Crop Weather Watch Group (CWWG) meeting 
every Monday.  Crop Weather Watch Group (CWWG) 
in the Economics, Statistics & Evaluation Division is 
an inter-departmental forum that undertakes weekly 
review of progress of crop sowing, weather 
conditions, reservoir levels, level of pest and disease, 
seeds and fertilizer availability, horticulture arrivals 
and prices. The purpose is to facilitate timely policy 
intervention and operational support by the 
concerned subject matter Divisions of the DA&FW, 
IMD, CWC, Crops, Fertilizer, Prices, Plant Protection, 
Horticulture, Seeds etc. Departments/Divisions give 
their inputs and participate in the meeting. The 
CWWG data and report are uploaded on the DA&FW 
website every week. Objective of the project is to 
provide multiple-in-season forecast based on 
Agromet, Econometric and Remote Sensing based 
methodology. MNCFC has been providing Remote 
Sensing based forecasts in respect of 9 major crops of 
the country jute, cotton, sugarcane, rice (Kharif & 
Rabi), wheat, rapeseed, mustard, sorghum (Rabi), 
pigeon pea/tur, pulses (Rabi).
Role of India Meteorological Department (IMD) has 
been limited to developing crop yield forecasting 
models based on multiple correlation and 
regression techniques in collaboration with 
Agromet Field Units (AMFUs) using both Statistical 
and Crop Growth Simulation Models. Crop yield 
forecast of major crops is issued at mid-season and 
pre-harvest stage using agromet models during 
Kharif as well as Rabi season for crops. Presently, 
IMD has been providing crop yield forecast in 
respect of Rice, Jute, Cotton and Sugarcane during 
Kharif season and wheat, potato, mustard and 
sorghum during Rabi season to MNCFC for the 
preparation of forecasts based on Remote Sensing.
IEG is providing Econometric model based State 
level / National level forecast of Area, Yield and 
Production in respect of 18 crops on monthly basis. 
The Crops are: Rice (Kharif & Rabi), Wheat, Maize 
(Kharif & Rabi), Bajra, Jowar (Kharif & Rabi), Moong 
(Kharif &Rabi), Gram Masur (Lentil), Rapeseed & 
Mustard, Urad (Kharif & Rabi), Groundnut (Kharif & 
Rabi), Soyabean, Caster Seed, Cotton, Jute and 
Sugarcane.The Model used for forecasting yield 
estimates takes into account crop price (expected), 
substitute crop price (expected), irrigation, pre-
sowing month reservoir and groundwater level, 
sowing season rainfall, rainfall in growing season, 
temperature in growing season and input price 
fertilizer, Nutrients (DAP, Ammonium Sulfate), 
Pesticides, Insecticides price.

III. The Committee on Doubling Farmers' Income 
(DFI),  in  their Report (Volume XII, Science for 
Doubling Farmers' Income), appreciated the 
transformation role of Digital Technology in 
modernizing agricultural activities.It pointed 
out how emerging technologies are 
revolutionizing agriculture by harnessing the 
power of  data analytics, artiﬁcial intelligence, 
and the Internet of Things to optimize crop 
management, enhance precision agriculture, 
and improve resource eﬃciency.
IV. 
Furthermore, in the last decade, a digital 
revolution has begun in India. Through the 
effective use of data, signiﬁcant growth is 
being witnessed across  various  sectors.  
Several  initiatives  of the  Government of  
India,  such  as  Digital India  Mission, National 
e- Governance Plan, Make in India, Startup 
India  and other signiﬁcant investments in 
technology  infrastructure,  have catalyzed the 
development of a  thriving  digital  ecosystem  
in India.  The Government of India has 
leveraged data and emerging technologies to 
improve governance, drive innovation and 
make informed decisions in various sectors 
such as ﬁnance, healthcare, retail, and 
agriculture. Additionally, the rise of digital 
transformation in key areas has led to 
exponential sectoral growth in the country 
and positioned India as a leader in the 
implementation of digital technologies.
V. 
In view of the above background, NeGPA 
guidelines were amended in FY 2020-21 to 
incorporate  projects  involving  the use of 
modern Information Technologies, such as 
Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Machine Learning, 
Blockchain Technology, the Internet of Things,

Overview 
 
Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare aims to 
improve awareness, knowledge and eﬃciency of 
farmers.  A  comprehensive ICT strategy has, 
therefore, been developed not only to reach out to 
farmers in an easy and better way but also for  
planning  and monitoring of schemes so that policy 
decisions can  be  taken  at  a faster pace and 
farmers can be beneﬁted quickly. To empower 
different sections of rural areas, different ICT 
strategies have been devised.
4.2  
Digital Agriculture (ersthwhile National 
e-Governance Plan – Agriculture):
I. 
Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare is 
implementing National e- Governance Plan – 
Agriculture (NeGP-A). Its aim is to achieve 
rapid development in India through use of 
Information & Communication Technology 
(ICT) for timely access to agriculture related 
information for the farmers. In Agriculture, 
availability of real time information at the 
right time is a continuous challenge. Lack of 
information at proper time causes loss to 
farmers. NeGP-A aims to bridge this gap in 
communication by using technology.
II. 
National e- Governance Plan in Agriculture 
(NeGPA) was initially launched in seven 
selected States namely, Assam, Himachal 
Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, 
Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, in the last 
quarter of 2010-11. This Scheme has 
subsequently extended in 2nd Phase to cover 
all the States and 7 UTs from 2014-15. NeGP-A 
aims to achieve rapid development in India 
through use of Information & Communication 
Technology (ICT) for timely access to 
agriculture related information for the 
farmers.

conducting  Digital  Crop Survey (DCS) to identify 
the crops being sown on every farmland plot in the 
country across all seasons. DCS will enable a single-
source-of-truth of crop sown data and will be a 
foundational block  in  the  Agri  Stack DPI.
The data from DCS will enable the agriculture 
ecosystem to enable various use-cases, i.e., Crop 
Diversiﬁcation and planning, near real- time crop 
estimation, Procurement planning and will also 
enable improvement in process-ﬂows of various 
ministry driven schemes such as PMFBY, KCC etc. to 
enable faster and more eﬃcient scheme delivery to 
the needy farmers.
Pilot of Digital Crop Survey has been conducted in 
10 States in Kharif 2023 : Assam, Gujarat, Uttar 
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra 
Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Telangana and 
Odisha. For conducting the pilot, the States are 
being supported under NeGPA scheme.

report: -
I) Horti cult ure C luster Develo pment 
Programme 
Horticulture Cluster Development Programme 
(CDP) aims to enable holistic growth and 
development of identified horticulture clusters to 
make them globally competitive and entrench them 
into national and global value chains. This 
programme is designed to leverage the 
geographical specialization of horticulture clusters 
and promote integrated and market-led 
development of pre-production, production, post-
harvest, logistics, marketing and branding 
activities.
National Horticulture Board (NHB) being Nodal 
Agency for implementation of the Programme has 
appointed M/s Grant Thornton Bharat LLP as 
Programme Management Unit to drive the 
programme and support in its implementation. 
Based on field visits and extensive feedback 
received from various stakeholders of the value 
chain, Operational Guideline for Horticulture 
Cluster Development Programme has been 
prepared and finalized. Further, it has been decided 
to implement the Pilot Phase of programme initially 
with shortlisted 12 clusters and the programme will 
be scaled up to cover all the 55 clusters based on the 
learnings from the pilot phase. 
The clusters of the pilot phase include Shopian 
(Jammu & Kashmir) and Kinnaur (Himachal 
Pradesh) for Apple, Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh), 
Kutch (Gujarat) and Mahbubnagar (Telangana) for 
Mango, Ananthapur (Andhra Pradesh) and Theni 
(Tamil Nadu) for Banana, Nasik (Maharashtra) for 
Grapes, Sepahijala (Tripura) for Pineapple, Solapur 
(Maharashtra) and Chitradurga (Karnataka) for 
Annual Report 2023-24

Pomegranate and West Jaintia Hills (Meghalaya) for 
Turmeric.
As per the implementation framework stipulated in 
guideline, Cluster Development Agency (CDA) has 
been appointed for each identified cluster for 
undertaking the detailed analysis on gaps and 
determining the scope for innovative interventions 
in the clusters. Based on the Cluster Gap 
Assessment Reports (CGARs) submitted by all 
CDAs, Request for Proposals (RFPs) were floated/ 
published by the CDA for selection of Implementing 
Agencies (IAs) for implementation of different 
verticals under CDP and one to one meeting with 
potential IAs were conducted.
With regards to the promotion/ awareness of 
Programme, National &State level newspaper 
advertisements were published by the NHB and 
CDA. Also, one day awareness programme under 
“Kisan Bhagidari Prathmikta Hamari” campaign, 
“Krishi Mela”in clusters and National Level 
Stakeholders meet were organized. 
On the fourth day of 'Kisan Bhagidari Prathmikta 
Hamari' campaign under Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, 
a virtual awareness session was organized on 28th 
April 2022 by the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Farmers' Welfare wherein 4000+ attendees 
including farmers and other stakeholders across 
India were participated.
Key objective of these campaigns was to generate 
mass awareness amongst farmers and other 
stakeholders about various schemes/ programmes 
including Cluster Development Programme being 
implemented by the MoA & FW, Animal Husbandry 
& Dairying and encourage them to avail the benefits.
Also, Krishi Mela were organized in clusters during 
June and July'22 for wider outreach of the 
programme and providing more understanding 
with regards to its implementation structure.
National Horticulture Board, Ministry of 
Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare organized 
Consultation Meet 2022 on 9  September 2022. The 
th
interactive session included technical input, 
personal effectiveness facilitation, and hands of 
experience sharing by the stakeholders involved in 
the Horticulture Cluster Development Programme.
In response to the Request for Proposals (RFPs)  
published for the selection of Implementing 
Agencies in all the Clusters till 31.12.2023, 
Implementing Agencies have been finalized for the 
implementation of projects in six (6) Clusters i.e., 
M/s  Pras ad Se eds  Private Lim ited for 
Mahabubnagar (Mango), M/s FIL Industries Private 
Limited for Shopian (Apple), Ms Sahyadri Farms 
Post Harvest Care Limited for Nashik (Grape), M/s 
Meghalaya Basin Management Agency for West 
Jaintia Hills (Turmeric), M/s BVG Global Farmworks 
Private Limited for Solapur (Pomegranate) and M/s 
Associated Industrial Corporation for Chitradurga 
(Pomegranate). Remaining clusters i.e., Kinnaur 
(Apple), Ananthapur (Banana), Theni (Banana) are 
under progress and 3 clusters i.e., Sepahijala 
(Pineapple), Kutch (Mango) and Lucknow (Mango) 
are under assessment for replacement with other 
potential clusters.
A total investment of approximately Rs.900 Crore 
has been approved for these 6 projects, which 
includes private contribution of approximately 
Rs.550 Cr and financial assistance of approximately 
Rs.350 Crore for their implementation. 
As the implementation shall be commenced in 6 
clusters, CDP-SURAKSHA (Cluster Development 
Programme - System for Unified Resource 
Allocation Knowledge and Secure Horticulture 
Assistance) Portal is being developed by M/s Grant 
Thornton being PMU to monitor, documentation, 
management, and fund disbursement processes 
within the Horticulture Cluster Development 
Programme. Portal shall facilitate streamlined 
collaboration, enhanced operations, and informed 
decision-making among stakeholders. Additionally, 
the integration of GIS and geo-tagging capabilities 
shall provide a comprehensive understanding of the 
horticulture clusters, aiding in identifying growth 
areas and assessing resource utilization.
NHB and PMU team are conducting Capacity 
Building workshops in cluster states where 
implementing agencies have been selected. These 
workshops are sensitizing, providing training and 
handholding for CDA officials, State Horticulture 
Departments officials and the IAs about the various 
operations, funds flow and reporting mechanism 
etc. under the Cluster Development Programme.

Chapter-9
9.1  
Overviews of Edible Oil Production:
India is heavily dependent on imports to meet its 
edible oil requirements and is the largest importer 
of vegetable oils in the world, followed by China and 
USA. Of all the imported edible oils, share of palm oil 
is about 59% followed by soybean oil with a share of 
23% and sunflower (17%). Import growth with 
respect to edible oils during the last decades is 
about 57%. The import figure of edible oils during 
2022-23 reveals that India imported a total of 15.53 
million tonnes of vegetable oils. The per capita 
consumption which was 15.80 kg/year/person in 
2012-13 has increased to 23.50 kg/year/person in 
20 23 . The  con su mp tion  is  arou nd  21 
kg/year/person during last five years. The year 
wise domestic production and import of edible oils 
in the country is given in (Chart -1).
Domestic edible oil production has not been able to 
keep pace with the growth in consumption. During 
2022-23, domestic production of edible oils was 
12.41 million tonnes from both primary (Oilseeds) 
and secondary sources (Coconut, Oil palm, Rice 
bran oil, Cotton seed oil and TBOs). The year wise 
demand and supply of edible oil during last five 
years in the country are given below.
Source-Directorate of Vegetable Oils
9.2 
 Overview of Oilseeds Production:
Oilseeds cultivation is undertaken across the 
country in about 30.24 million hectares, largely 
under rainfed areas covering 69% of the total area 
and producing around 41.36 million tons of 
oilseeds. Nine oilseeds are the major source of 
vegetable oil in the country, among which Soybean 
(36%), Rapeseed & Mustard (31%) and Groundnut 
(25%) contributes to more than 92% of total 
oilseeds production in the country.

However, in terms of vegetable oil production 
Mustard, Soybean and Groundnut contributes 
29.13%, 18.03% and 17.53% respectively.
Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and 
Maharashtra are the major oilseeds producing 
states contributing more than 77% of oilseeds 
production in the country. During 2022-23, Area, 
production and yield was 30.24 million ha, 41.36 
million tonnes and 1368 kg/ha respectively. The 
highest ever production of oilseeds was achieved 
during 2022-23. (Chart-2)
* Final estimate
In view of the aforesaid background, Oilseeds 
Division is mandated with the activities related to 
increasing production and productivity of oilseeds 
and area of expansion under oil palm & TBOs for 
increasing domestic availability of edible oils.
9.3.
On-going Scheme
 
9.3.1 National Food Security Mission (Oilseeds 
 
& Oil Palm) – NFSM (OS&OP)
With effect from 2018-19, the NMOOP scheme has 
been merged with National Food Security Mission 
(NFSM) and is being implemented as NFSM 
(OS&OP). This scheme comprises of three sub-
missions namely, NFSM-Oilseeds, NFSM-Oil Palm 
and NFSM-TBOs. The scheme is being implemented 
through the State Departments of Agriculture/ 
Horticulture. The focus of the assistance under the 
various interventions of the scheme is to benefit the 
farmers and have a direct impact on increasing the 
farmers income involved in oilseed cultivation. 
Component share between the GoI:State is 90:10 % 
for North East and Hilly States, 100% for UTs / 
Central Agencies and 60:40 % for other states.  
Now, the Government has launched a separate 
Mission for Oil Palm, which is the National Mission 
for Edible Oils (Oil Palm) - NMEO (OP) in 2021 to 
promote oil palm cultivation for making the country 
Atmanirbhar in edible oils with special focus on 
North-Eastern States and Andaman and Nicobar 
Islands. NMEO (OP) has been launched by targeting 
an additional 6.5 lakh hectare area from 2021-22 to 
2025-26.
Both NFSM- Oilseeds and NMEO (OP) are being 
implemented in the country with the objective of 
augmenting the availability of edible oils by 
increasing the production and productivity of 
oilseeds and oil palm and reducing the import 
burden. 
9.3.2 Oilseeds Production Achievement during 
 
2022-23:
 
i. To augment the availability of vegetable oils 
and to reduce the import of edible oils by 
increasing the production and productivity 
of oilseeds from an average production of 
33.42 million tonnes and productivity of 
1236 kg/ha, during 12  plan period, to 
th
production of 41.36 million tonnes and yield 
of 1368 kg/ha, by the end of 2022-23.
 
ii. An area of 88.50 lakh ha-under Special 
Programme on Rapeseed and Mustard, 
during 2022-23.

iii. An area of 2621 ha - under TBOs namely Olive, 
Mahua, Kokum, Wild Apricot, Neem, Jojoba, 
Karanja, Simaroba and Tung during 2022-23.
9.4.
Strategies of Oilseeds Production
 
Strategies for enhancing the productivity (and 
profitability) of oilseed-based production systems 
are prepared majorly for the annual oilseeds in the 
country. The interventions/ strategies proposed in 
oilseeds are time-tested with scale neutrality that 
can be grounded for enhancing the productivity of 
the oilseed-based production system with 
necessary institutional support/ handholding. The 
proposed strategies are categorized under four 
categories as follows:
 
1. Horizontal (area) expansion and vertical 
(productivity increase) expansion of 
oilseeds crop. Focus on strategies such as 
rice fallow, intercropping and crop 
diversification.
 
2. Increasing seed production and distribution 
of newly released varieties.  
 
3. Low-cost technologies with high impact on 
productivity resulting in higher income, 
with emphasis on eco-friendliness, high 
input use efficiency
 
4. Strategies with emphasis on improving 
employment in the sector through skill / 
entrepreneurship development. 
The newer opportunities to explore non-traditional 
seasons and regions for crops are also projected 
that have proven success for area expansion and 
integration into major cropping systems.
9.5.
Annual Action Plan of NFSM (OS) during 
 
2023-24:

National Mission on Edible Oils-Oil Palm 
 
(NMEO-OP):
A new Centrally Sponsored Scheme namely, 
National Mission on Edible Oil (NMEO)-Oil Palm 
(NMEO-OP) has been launched by Government to 
promote oil palm cultivation for making the 
country 
in edible oils with special 
Aatmanirbhar 
focus on North-Eastern States and A&N Islands. 
The Mission will bring additional area of 6.5 lakh 
ha under Oil Palm plantation with 3.28 lakh ha in 
north-eastern states and 3.22 in Rest of India in 
next 5 years from 2021-22 to 2025-26. Under 
NMEO-OP the cost will be shared as 60:40 between 
the Central and the State Government for General 
states and 90:10 for NE states and 100% for UTs 
and Central Agencies.
The major focus of the Mission is to provide 
Viability price of FFBs to the farmers linked with 
assured procurement by the industry with simple 
price fixing formula. Central government will 
compensate farmers through viability gap 
payment, if price paid by industry is below 
viability price.
The Government has assessed that a total area of 
around 28 lakh hectares in the country and around 
9.62 lakh hectares for the Northeast alone fit for oil 
palm cultivation. Out of the total assessed area, only 
4.60 lakh hectares is under oil palm cultivation 
including NE states at present only of which about 
2.00 lakh ha is fruiting area. Hence there is a lot of 
potential for the growth of oil palm in the country.
The mission will result in increase in oil palm by 6.5 
lakh hectares by 2025-26 and 16.71 lakh ha by 
2029-30. The current fruiting area which is 1.89 
lakh hectares will be increased to 2.80 lakh hectares 
by 2025-26 and above 8.50 lakh hectares by 2029-
30. The expected FFBs production will be 75.19 lakh 
tonnes by 2025-26 and 170.00 lakh tonnes by 2029-
30. The CPO production is expected to increase 
upto28.11lakh tones by 2029-30.
The total estimated cost of the NMEO (Oil Palm) is ₹ 
8844 crore GOI share, ₹ 2196 crore state share, and 
total of ₹ 11,040 crore including Viability Gap 
funding with a cost of ₹ 1163 crore. (Rest of India-
₹1144 crore and ₹19.00 crore for NE states and 
Andaman & Nicobar Islands till 2025-26.
The progress of NMEO-OP and action to be

10.1   Overview
National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture 
(NMSA)
National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) 
is one of the Missions launched under the National 
Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2008. The 
Mission aims to evolve and implement strategies to 
make Indian agriculture resilient to climate change. 
NMSA was approved for three major components i.e. 
Rainfed Area Development (RAD); On Farm Water 
Management (OFWM); and Soil Health Management 
(SHM). Subsequently, four new programmes were 
introduced under the ambit of NMSA namely Soil 
Health Card (SHC), Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana 
(PKVY), Mission Organic Value Chain Development in 
North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER). During 2015-
16, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) 
was operationalised wherein the OFWM component 
of NMSA was subsumed under the Per Drop More 
Crop (PDMC) component of PMKSY. In addition to the 
aforementioned programmes under NMSA, the 
Restructured National Bamboo Mission (NBM) was 
launched in April 2018. Details of these schemes are 
mentioned in the write up of the respective Program 
Divisions.
The NMSA Strategy document was revised for the 
period 2018 to 2030 and has adopted an integrated 
holistic approach focussing more on vulnerable 
regions, deploying the best bet technologies and 
practices for adaptation and mitigation and 
empowering farmers through capacity building and 
financial support. Implementation strategies are 
designed with a time frame up to 2030. Eleven key 
priority areas have been identified for 
programmatic interventions which can minimize 
the impact of climate change and reduce risk. Each 
of these priority areas has to be analysed in the 
context of four functional areas, viz., Research and 
Development, Technology Adoption, Infrastructure 
and Capacity Building measures.
From 2022-23, various programmes / schemes of 
NMSA have been subsumed under Rashtriya Krishi 
Vikas Yojana (RKVY) as RKVY-Annual Action Plan 
based programme. The schemes related to NMSA 
are given as under:

 Rainfed Farming Systems 
Food grain production in the country accrues from 
approximately 139.18 million hectare of net area 
sown. Of this, 69.48 million hectares is net irrigated 
and the remaining area of about 69.70 million 
hectares is under rainfed conditions (as per Land

Use Statistics at a Glance 2017-18). Rainfed 
agriculture is complex, diverse and risk prone 
characterized by low levels of productivity and low 
input usage. Rainfed areas if managed properly have 
the potential to contribute a larger share in the 
overall production of food grains in the country. In 
view of this, the Government of India has accorded 
very high priority to the holistic and sustainable 
development of rainfed areas through efficient use of 
water management at farm level and appropriate 
farming systems etc. In this context, the RFS division 
is implementing the Per Drop More Crop Component 
(PDMC) and Rainfed Area Development (RAD) 
component of the National Mission for Sustainable 
Agriculture (NMSA). Besides, a dedicated Micro 
Irrigation Fund (MIF) has been instituted with 
NABARD with a corpus of Rs. 5000 crores for 
expanding coverage of Micro Irrigation which has 
been proposed to be doubled to 10000 crores. 
10.2.1  Per Drop More Crop Component (PDMC): 
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare 
(DA&FW) is implementing Centrally Sponsored 
Scheme of Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) in the country 
from 2015-16. From the year 2015-16 to 2021-22, 
the PDMC was implemented as component of 
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). 
From the year 2022-23, the PDMC is being 
implemented under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas 
Yojana (RKVY). PDMC focuses on enhancing water 
use efficiency at farm level through Micro Irrigation 
namely Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation Systems. 
Activities of Micro Irrigation:
 
· 
Drip Irrigation: Irrigating root zone through 
emitters fitted on a lateral tube.
 
· 
Sprinkler Irrigation: Water is discharged 
under pressure in the air through a set of 
nozzles attached to a network of pipes.
Benefits of Micro Irrigation:
The Micro Irrigation helps in water saving as well as 
reduced fertilizer usage through fertigation, labour 
expenses, and other input costs, while sustaining 
soil health and overall income enhancement of 
farmers. 
Salient Features of PDMC Scheme:
 
 
The Government provides financial 

assistance @ 55% for small and marginal 
farmers and @ 45% for other farmers for 
installation of Drip and Sprinkler systems 
under the PMKSY- PDMC. Besides, some 
States provide additional incentives/ 
subsidy to farmers for encouraging 
installation of Micro Irrigation.
 
·  The Assistance for installation of Micro 

Irrigation systems is limited to 5 hectares 
per beneficiary with subsidy cycle of 7 
years.   
 
·  25% higher amounts have been taken into 

consideration while working out the unit 
cost for the North Eastern and Himalayan 
states, UTs of J&K and Ladhak and 15% 
higher for low penetration of Micro 
Ir ri g at io n S t a te s n a m e ly  Bi ha r,  
Chhattisgarh, Goa, Punjab,  Jharkhand, 
Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and 
Union Territories for larger adoption of 
systems by the farmers under the scheme.

An area of 78.47 lakh ha has been covered under 
Micro Irrigation in the country through PDMC from 
2015-16 to 2022-23 which is 69% higher 
achievement as compared to the corresponding 
Pre-PDMC eight years period. Besides, an area of 4 
lakh ha has been covered during 2023-24 (as on 
31.12.23). Total area of 82.48 lakh ha has been 
covered under PDMC as on 31.12.23. 
10.2.2 Micro Irrigation Fund (MIF): Micro 
Irrigation Fund (MIF) with corpus of Rs. 5000 
crores have been created with National Bank for 
Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). The 
objective of the MIF is to facilitate he States in 
mobilising resources for expanding coverage of 
micro irrigation. The States may access MIF for 
taking up special and innovative projects for 
expanding coverage of Micro Irrigation and also for 
incentivising micro irrigation beyond the 
provisions available under PDMC scheme to 
encourage farmers. Projects of Rs 4724.74 crore 
have been approved to the States and so far Rs 
2812.24 cr has been disbursed to the States of 
Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Punjab, 
Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu on reimbursement basis.
A Budget Announcement has been made by the 
Government during the year 2021-22 to double the 
initial corpus of MIF by augmenting another Rs. 
5,000 crores.
Findings of Evaluation Study of PDMC:
Recent evaluation studies of the scheme have 
reiterated that Micro Irrigation is relevant in 
achieving national priorities such as improving on-
farm water use efficiency, enhancing crop 
p ro du c ti v it y,  g en e ra t in g  em p l oy m en t  
opportunities, improving quality of agri/horti. 
products and increase the farmer's income.
10.2.3 Rainfed Area Development (RAD): To 
mainstream development of rainfed areas in a 
sustainable manner, Rainfed Area Development 
(RAD) Scheme was made operational from 2014-15 
in the country as a component of National Mission 
for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA). Rainfed Area 
Development (RAD) aims at promoting sustainable 
agriculture production through adaptation of 
agricultural climatic zone wise Integrated Farming 
System (IFS) models developed by Indian Council of 
Agriculture research (ICAR). RAD aims at 
promoting integrated farming system (IFS) with 
emphasis on multi-cropping, rotational cropping, 
inter-cropping, mixed-cropping practices with 
allied activities like horticulture, livestock, fishery, 
apiculture, etc. to enable farmers not only in 
maximizing the farm returns for sustaining 
livelihood, but also to mitigate the impacts of 
drought, flood or other extreme weather events. 
RAD component is implemented under the 
umbrella scheme 'Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana ' 
from the year 2022-23 onward.
The various activities supported under RAD 
component includes Integrated Farming System-
cropping systems, Fishery, Apiculture, Silage 
making for increased availability of green fodder 
round the year, Vermi compost Units/organic input 
production unit, green manuring etc. Since its 
inception (2014-15) and up to 2022-23, an area of 
7.12 lakh ha rainfed area has been brought under 
Integrated Framing System under RAD with an 
expenditure of Rs. 1619.73 cr. During 2023-24, an 
amount of Rs.80.71 crore has been released upto 
31st December, 2023 to the States for the 
implementation of the programme.  
 Salient Features of RAD:
 
a. 
A cluster based approach of 20 ha. or more 
(contiguous or non contiguous in difficult 
terrain with close proximity in a 
village/adjoining villages) has been 
adopted to derive noticeable impact of

strengthening of FPOs through involvement 
in the implementation of the program has 
been emphasized upon. 
 
b. Priority has  be en giv en to Gram 
Panchayat/Blocks having more than 60% of 
the area under uplands/rain-fed, Natural 
Farming Clusters, Watersheds area taken up 
under WDC project in last 20 yrs, Gram 
Panchayat/Blocks which are the focus areas 
of NRLM, Aspirational Districts etc.
 
c. 
Millets perform exceptionally well in 
rainfed areas due to its hardiness and 
capacity to withstand climatic aberration. 
Cultivation of millets has been preferred in 
RAD thus contributing to Government's 
strategy to promote millets. At least 25% 
area of the cluster is to be taken up for 
Millets cultivation.
 
d. The scheme also promotes climate resilient 
agriculture practices. Indian Council of 
Agricultural Research (ICAR) implements 
flagship network project namely National 
Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture 
(NICRA) to promote climate resilient 
agricultural practices. In order to 
replicate/upscale the experiences gained in 
NICRA, the RAD Cluster would be 
linked/include the nearest NICRA Villages.
10.3  Agro Forestry
As a follow up to the recommendation of the 
National Agroforestry Policy, 2014, Sub-Mission on 
Agroforestry (SMAF) - 'Har Medh par Ped' under 
National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture 
(NMSA) was conceived to promote plantation on 
farmlands. The scheme(SMAF) was implemented 
from 2016-17 to 2021-22 with an aim of providing 
an additional source of income to the farmers. Since 
inception of the scheme in 2016-17, a total of 682 
lakh trees under the 1.61 lakh Hectare have been 
planted in the country. Under the Scheme, around 
899 nurseries have been set up/developed.
SMAF was discontinued during 2022-23. The 
program continues as Agroforestry component of 
RKVY from 2023-24 with objective of encouraging 
and expanding tree plantation in a complementary 
and integrated manner with crops to improve 
productivity. The scheme will ensure the 
availability of Quality Planting Materials (QPM) like 
seeds, seedlings, clones, hybrids, improved 
varieties, etc. The scheme focuses on Quality 
Planting Material (QPM) of healthy, resilient and 
adaptable nursery stock raised through seed or 
vegetative propagation with an overall goal to 
improve the quality of the plants available to 
farmers and growers. The objectives of the scheme 
includes;

10.6  Climate Change
Climate Change Cell under Natural Resource 
Management Division is a Nodal unit for PM Council 
for Climate Change to establish an effective inter 
and intra Departmental/Ministerial co-ordination 
for National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture 
(NMSA).  The Cell collate activities being 
undertaken by other Divisions/Departments such 
as INM, MIDH, Crops, Animal Husbandry, ICAR etc. 
for preparing and communicating a consolidated 
report to Ministry of Environment Forest and 
Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and other committees.
Indian Agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate 
change with approximately 51 percent of cultivated 
areas under rainfed conditions. Climate change is 
causing significant shifts in weather patterns 
throughout the world and it is expected to impact 
agricultural production systems thereby posing 
major challenges to the livelihoods and food security 
to millions of people.  As per the latest Inter 
Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
Assessment Report (AR-6), increase in rainfall, 
higher inter annual variability, intense and frequent 
heat waves, likely temperature increase by 1.5 to 4.0  
o
C and rise in sea level by 300 mm could be the major 
challenges for sustainable agriculture in the coming 
years (IPCC, 2021). Agricultural production in India 
is becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate 
variability characterized by temperature rise and 
altered frequency, timing and magnitude of 
precipitation. One or other part of the country is 
experiencing frequent extreme weather events 
causing sizeable loss of yield and income to the 
farmers at micro scale and to the nation's economy at 
macroeconomic level. This necessitates accelerated 
research for developing resilient and smart 
technologies wherever feasible to combat climate 
change as well as their mainstreaming through 
adaptation mechanisms. Therefore, Government of 
India has accorded a high priority on research and 
development to cope with climate change in general 
and agriculture in particular. During the sessions of 
COP26 Climate Summit, Glasgow, Scotland (2021), 
Government of India declared 5 commitments 
(Panchamrit) to deal with climate change. India, 
through its Nationally Determined Contributions( 
NDC) committed to become carbon neutral and 
achieve net zero emissions by the year 2070. India 
has identified agriculture as a sector for taking up 
adaptation as climate action.

10.6.3 Constitution of Carbon Credit Cell in NRM 
Division
Carbon markets can offer opportunities to mobilize 
investments in priority sectors such as agriculture, 
forest and land use. Carbon markets have gained 
significant momentum in recent years and  can help 
to accelerate the transformation needed towards 
more sustainable agriculture practices. Developing 
carbon market in agriculture can be an important 
driver towards more remunerative agriculture 
practices linking farmers to carbon markets. In view 
of above a separate Cell, has been constituted in 
NRM Division to explore the possibilities for carbon 
market in Agriculture Sector. Many interventions 
lunched under National Mission on Sustainable 
Agriculture (NMSA) such as agroforestry, micro 
irrigation, crop diversification, National Bamboo 
Mission, Natural / organic farming, Integrated 
Farming Systems, etc. have potential to sequester 
carbon in soil or reduce emission thus creating 
opportunities for small holder farmers towards 
carbon trading and receiving incentives.
10.6.4 Activities related to Mission LiFE

10.9  National Centre of Organic and Natural 
Farming (NCONF)
1)  
Role of the NCONF as enabler and catalyst 
for implementation of Participatory Guarantee 
System of India (PGS-India)
Government is implementing Participatory 
Guarantee System of India (PGS-India) through 
NCONF Ghaziabad as a quality assurance initiative 
for certification of organic produce that is locally 
relevant, emphasizing the participation of 
stakeholders, including producers / farmers and 
consumers and operate outside the frame of third-
party certification. In the operation of PGS-India, 
stakeholders (including farmers/ producers) are 
involved in decision making and essential decisions 
about the operation of the PGS-India certification 
itself by assessing, inspecting and verifying the 
production practices of each other and collectively 
declare produce as organic.
PGS-India has a number of basic elements which 
embrace a participatory approach, a shared vision, 
transparency and trust. Participation is an essential 
and dynamic part of PGS. Key stakeholders 
(producers, consumers, retailers, traders and 
others such as NGOs, PGS-facilitators and service 
providers) are helping in capacity building and 
making farmers aware in group formation, system 
operation, decision making and integrity 
management. In the operation of PGS, stakeholders 
(including producers) are involved in decision 
making and essential decisions about the operation 
of the PGS itself. PGS Groups in addition to being 
involved in the mechanics of the PGS, stakeholders, 
particularly the farm-producers are engaged in a 
structured ongoing learning process, which helps 
them improve what they do. The learning process is 
usually 'hands-on' and involves field days or 
workshops. The idea of participation embodies the 
principle of collective responsibility for ensuring 
the organic integrity of the PGS. Although PGS-India 
is basically a farmer group centric organic 
guarantee system but to integrate all sections of 
producers, processors, handlers and traders, to 
complete the value chain from farm to fork and keep 
the PGS-India programme as central guiding force 
to the entire organic agriculture movement, it also 
provides for an access to individual producers, 
individual processing and handling facilities under 
PGS groups, organized processing, warehousing, 
handling and packaging and trading entities away 
from producer groups. To ensure end-to-end 
traceability (as per the requirements of regulatory 
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
105
framework under FSS [Organic Foods] Regulation 
2017). PGS-India programme also provides 
uninterrupted chain of custody, starting from 
producer groups till the products are processed and 
finally packed into retail packs. 
To integrate traditionally organic areas in to 
mainstream organic and harvest the benefits of 
traditionally organic practices for safe and healthy 
certified organic food for consumers, PGS-India 
programme also provides for a mechanism to 
certify large contiguous areas, involving village 
councils and Gram Panchayats by adopting village 
wise conformity assessment on annual basis.

Training programmes (online and 
offline)
Organic farming has come a long way during the last 
two decades with the efforts of the Indian 
Government and as a result India has emerged as 
the 1  largest in terms of producers with significant 
st
increase in area under organic. Emerging policies 
and programmes of Central Government supported 
by States for reduction in chemicals and shift of 
Indian agriculture towards organic/natural or non-
chemical methods is an indication of determination 
to secure health of citizens by creating options for 
safe and healthy food. Therefore, to gear up the 
Governments mission on implementation of 
Chemical free farming across the country, NCONF 
has proposed variety of training programs focusing 
farmers, Officers of Central and State Govt. Depts., 
members of RCs/SPs, Krishi Sakhis, Women Self 
Help Groups and for other Stakeholders endorsing 
chemical free farming. Recently, NCONF Ghaziabad 
has received the administrative and financial 
approval for Rs 99.99 lakhs for organizing various 
HRD programs as per the Annual Action Plan. These 
training programs will help in creating awareness, 
mobilization, capacity building at grassroot level 
and exploring possibilities to identify key focus 
areas for implementing the organic and natural 
farming across the country in addition to 
showcasing achievements of selected natural/ 
organic growers.

10.13 Soil Heath & Fertility of RKVY Scheme 
Soil Health Management was one of the most 
important interventions for Sustainable 
Agriculture. During 15th finance commission 
period, Soil Health & Fertility is implemented to 
promote the Integrated Nutrient Management 
through judicious use of chemical fertilizers 
including secondary and micronutrients in 
conjunction with organic manures and bio-
fertilizers for improving soil health and its 
productivity as component of RKVY Cafeteria 
Scheme. The strengthening of soil and fertilizer 
testing facilities is to provide soil test based 
recommendations to farmers for improving soil 
fertility, up-gradation of skill and knowledge of 
farmers through training & demonstrations etc.  
The Soil Health & Fertility include setting up of new 
static Soil Testing Laboratories (STLs), setting up of 
new Mobile STLs, setting up of Village Level STLs/ 
Mini STLs, strengthening of existing Static/ Mobile 
STLs, setting up of new Fertilizer Quality Control 
Laboratory (FQCL), strengthening of FQCL, Setting 
up of Bio-fertilizer & Organic Fertilizer Quality 
Control Laboratories (BOQCL), strengthening of 
BOQCL, promoting Micro-nutrients, training & 
Demonstrations, Reclamation of problem Soils, 
NABL Accreditation and New Initiatives and testing 
soil samples to issue Soil Health Cards. Soil Samples 
should be processed as per standard procedures 
and analyzed for 12 parameters viz, pH, electrical 
conductivity (EC), Organic Carbon, available N, P, K, 
S and micronutrients (Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn & B). Soil 
Health Card provides information to farmers on soil 
nutrient status of their soil and recommendation on 
appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for 
improving soil health and its fertility.

Overview
 
Farmers' Welfare Division of this Department is 
entrusted with the formulation, implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation of two new Central 
Sector Schemes of the Government, namely, the 
Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) 
and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan Dhan Yojana 
(PM-KMY).
11.2 Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-
KISAN):
PM-KISAN is a central sector scheme launched on 
24 February 2019 to supplement the financial 
needs of land-holding farmers. Under this scheme, 
the financial benefit of Rs 6,000/- per year in three 
equal installments every four months is transferred 
into the bank accounts of farmers' families across 
the country through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) 
mode. The scheme leverages technological & and 
process advancements so that the maximum 
number of beneficiaries can benefit without any 
hassle. The scheme leverages technological and 
process advancements so that the maximum 
number of beneficiaries can benefit without any 
hassle.
Since the launch of the PM-KISAN scheme, it has 
been centred on using technology to guarantee that 
all eligible farmers get the benefit of the scheme. To 
this end, the scheme has continually evolved by 
integrating various systems including use of Digital 
Public Goods such as authentication through 
Aadhaar, Aadhaar based payment system, Income 
tax and PFMS verification, Pensioner data in PMFS, 
land records as per the Record of Rights, on-
boarding of IPPB as highlighted in the image below. 
A farmer-centric digital infrastructure has ensured 
the benefits of the scheme reach all the farmers 
across the country without any involvement of the 
middlemen, maintaining absolute transparency in 
registering and verifying beneficiaries. The process 
of release of installment is transparent and there is 
no involvement of a middleman between the 
Government of India and farmers. From the 13th 
installment onwards 100% payment of PM-KISAN 
installments are being released to the Aadhaar-
seeded bank accounts of the beneficiaries directly 
from the Government of India.
Under the Scheme, The Ministry of Agriculture and 
Farmers Welfare, Government of India, has 
launched the PM Kisan Mobile APP with a Face 
Authentication Feature to enable farmers to 
complete their e-KYCs from their mobiles. This App 
is very simple and convenient to use. Farmers can 
easily download the App from the Google Play Store 
on their Android phones. Farmers through this app 
can complete their e-KYC sitting at home even in 
remote areas of the country without any OTP or 
fingerprint, just by scanning their face. In addition, 
the Government of India, recognizing the need to 
compulsorily complete e-KYC, has also extended the 
ability to do e-KYC of farmers to state government 
officials, allowing each official to do e-KYC for 500 
farmers so that wherever they go they can facilitate 
the farmers in completing their e-KYCs. 
Further, to make the lives of our PM KISAN 
beneficiaries easy, the Government has developed 
the “Know Your Status” (KYS) module using the 
technology available within the existing ecosystem. 
Through KYS farmers can know the status of their 
land seeding, Aadhaar linking with bank accounts, 
e-KYC, eligibility, and payment. Also, if e-KYC has not 
been done, then the farmer can reach the e-KYC 
Module with one click and can complete his/her e-
KYC successfully.
Under the PM KISAN scheme – the AI chatbot PM 
KISAN e-Mitra was launched on 21  September 
st
2023. Considering the large beneficiary base of the 
scheme, to promptly address the general queries

and grievances raised by the beneficiaries, the 
Ministry has proactively developed the PM-KISAN 
AI Chatbot (Kisan e-Mitra). It acts as a one-stop 
solution to provide prompt, clear, and accurate 
responses to the grievances related to the PM-
KISAN scheme in their native language. Currently, 
the chatbot is available in English, Hindi, Bengali, 
Odia, Telugu, and Tamil. Further, by November 23, it 
will be available in all 22 languages of the country.
By implementing these innovative tools, the 
Ministry seeks to enhance the overall efficiency of 
the scheme's support system, empowering farmers 
with easy access to information and timely 
resolution of any concerns they may have.
As mentioned by the Hon'ble PM in his speech, “We 
are creating modern digital infrastructure in India 
while also ensuring that the benefits of the digital 
revolution reach every section of the society”. PM 
KISAN Yojana has become a great example of Modi 
Ji's vision of using digital public infrastructure for 
the welfare of Indian farmers, in which effective use 
of available technologies has ensured the Last mile 
delivery of the benefits and has taken the PM KSIAN 
Yojana to new dimensions.

activities.
A farmer-centric digital infrastructure has ensured 
the benefits of the scheme reach all the farmers 
across the country without any involvement of the 
middlemen. So far, the Government of India has 
disbursed over Rs 2.61 Lakhs Cr. to more than 11 
Cr. farmers' families into Aadhaar-seeded bank 
accounts. Impact of Digital Public Goods as

11.2.5
 Mechanism of Implementation of the 
 
Scheme
 
i. 
A high-level committee comprising of the 
Union Ministers of Finance, Agriculture and 
Land Resources has been constituted for 
making necessary modifications in the 
scheme within the overall financial 
parameters of income support approved by 
t h e  G o ve r n m e n t  fo r  e ff e c t i ve  
implementation.
 
ii. 
In some of the North-Eastern States, land 
ownership is community based. In such 
States, an alternate implementation 
mechanism of eligibility will be developed 
for the farmers and shall be implemented 
with the approval of a High Level 
Committee comprising of Ministers of the 
Ministry of Development of North-East 
Region(DoNER), Ministry of Rural 
Development (Department of Land 
Resources), Ministry of Agriculture & 
Farmers' Welfare and the concerned State 
Chief Minister or State nominated Minister.
 
iii. Special identification procedures have been 
devised for the States of Manipur and 
Nagaland in view of the community based 
land ownership in these states.
 
iv. Extension of benefit of the scheme to forest 
dweller tribes: The Government has 
decided to include tribals who have been 
given 'Pattas' under the Scheduled Tribes 
and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers 
(Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, 
subject to other eligibility conditions.
 
v. 
Jharkhand: Jharkhand does not have 
updated land records, as for many decades 
the mutation of land records on the basis of 
succession have not been recorded. Further, 
transfer of land is also restricted in these 
areas. This posed a difficulty in the 
implementation of the Scheme in 
Jharkhand. Therefore, with the approval of 
the HLC, the following procedure shall be 
adopted for identification of beneficiaries 
under the PM-KISAN Scheme in Jharkhand –
 
 
The farmer shall be asked to submit 
'Vanshavali' (Lineage) linked to the entry of 
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
123
land record comprising his/her ancestor's 
name giving a chart of succession. This 
lineage chart shall be submitted before the 
Gram Sabha for calling objections. After 
approval of the Gram Sabha, the village 
level/circle level revenue officials will verify 
and authenticate the Vanshavali and 
possession of holding. This authenticated list 
of farmers after due verification of 
succession chart shall be counter signed by 
the District Level Revenue authority. 
Farmers' names, subject to the exclusion 
criterion after following the aforementioned 
process, shall be uploaded on the PM-KISAN 
portal along with other required details for 
disbursement of benefit under the Scheme.

the Chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary with 
Secretaries of Department of Economic 
Affairs, Agriculture, Land Resources and 
Information Technology as members has 
been constituted to review and monitor 
implementation of the Scheme.
 
vii. The States shall prepare database of eligible 
beneficiary landholder farmer families in 
the villages capturing the Name, Age, 
Gender,  Category (SC/ ST), Aadhaar 
Number (in case Aadhaar Number has not 
been issued then Aadhaar Enrollment 
Number together with any other 
prescribed documents for purposes of

other identification documents issued  by  
Central/State/ UT Governments or their 
authorities, etc.), Bank Account Number 
and the Mobile Number of the beneficiaries. 
Responsibility of identifying the landholder 
farmer family eligible for benefit under the 
scheme shall be of the State/UT 
Government. In case of beneficiaries in 
States/UTs of Assam and Meghalaya where 
Aadhaar number has not been issued to 
most of the citizens, Aadhaar number shall 
be collected for those beneficiaries where it 
is available and for others alternate 
prescribed documents can be collected for 
identity verification purposes. States/UTs 
shall ensure that there is no duplication of 
the payment transferred to eligible families. 
Speedy re conciliation in case of 
wrong/incomplete bank details of the 
beneficiary should be ensured.
 
viii. Possession of Aadhaar number for release 
of benefits under the Scheme was optional 
for release of the 1st Instalment. It became 
mandatory for release of the 2nd 
Instalment except for the States/UTs of 
Assam, Meghalaya and J&K where Aadhaar 
penetration is miniscule. Releases under 
the Scheme are being made only on the 
basis of Aadhaar seeded database of all 
beneficiaries. 
 
ix. For the purpose of exclusion, States have to 
take a  self-declaration  from the 
beneficiaries. In the said self-declaration 
taken by the States/UT Governments, an 
undertaking should also be included 
wherein the consent of the beneficiaries 
should be taken for using the Aadhaar 
number for verification of his eligibility for 
the scheme with the concerned agencies.
 
x. 
From the period Aug'22 to Nov'22, land 
seeding has been made mandatory for 
release of benefits to a beneficiary. The 
existing land-ownership system in the 
concerned State/UT will be used for 
identification of beneficiaries.
 
xi. The lists of eligible beneficiaries would be 
published at the village level. Small and 
Marginal Farmer families who are eligible 
but have been excluded should be provided 
an opportunity to represent their case.
 
xii. The beneficiaries, whose names are 
uploaded on PM-KISAN Portal by the 
State/UT Government in a particular 4-
month period / trimester, shall be entitled to 
receive benefit for that trimester and for 
further installments pertaining to the 
subsequent trimesters for that financial year.

11.3.2 Aims and objective of the Schème 
There have been a series of interventions for income 
and price support by the Government for farmers. 
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
129
However, there is a felt need to create a social 
security net for farmers as old age may result in loss 
of livelihood for many of them. Farming requires 
hard work in fields which becomes difficult at an 
advanced age. The problem is compounded in 
respect of small and marginal farmers as they have 
minimal or no savings to provide for old age. The 
Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan-Dhan Yojana (PM-
KMY) provides for an assured monthly pension of 
Rs. 3000/- to all land holding Small and Marginal 
Farmers (SMFs), whether male or female, on 
attaining the age of 60 years. Farmers falling within 
the purview of the exclusion criteria are, however, 
not eligible for the benefit.
11.3.3  Beneficiaries of the Scheme 
All Small and Marginal Farmers (SMFs) in all States 
and Union Territories of the country, who are of the 
age of 18 years and above and upto the age of 40 
years, and who do not fall within the purview of the 
exclusion criteria are eligible to avail the benefits of 
this Scheme by joining it.
11.3.4 Exclusion criteria:
The following categories of farmers have been 
brought under the exclusion criteria:
 
i. 
SMFs covered under any other statutary 
social security schemes such as National 
Pension Scheme (NPS), Employees' State 
Insurance Corporation Scheme, Employees' 
Fund Organization Scheme etc.
 
ii. Farmers who have opted for Pradhan Mantri 
Shram Yogi MaanDhan Yojana (PM-SYM) 
administered by the Ministry of Labour & 
Employment
 
iii. Farmers who have opted for Pradhan Mantri 
LaghuVyapariMaan-dhan Yojana (PM-LVM) 
administered by the Ministry of Labour & 
Employment
 
iv. Further, the following categories of 
beneficiaries of higher economic status shall 
not be eligible for benefits under the 
scheme:
 
 
o All institutional land holders
 
 
o Former    and    present    holders    of 
constitutional posts

Agriculture Insurance
12.1 Keeping in view the risks involved in 
agriculture and to insure the farming community 
against various risks, the Ministry of Agriculture & 
Farmers Welfare introduced a crop insurance 
scheme in 1985 and thereafter brought 
improvements in the erstwhile scheme(s) from 
time to time based on the experience gained and 
views of the stakeholders, including States and, 
farming community etc.  The insurance schemes 
currently under implementation are the Pradhan 
Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and the 
Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance 
Scheme (RWBCIS).
Considering the experience gained, demands from 
farmers and report of the Working Group 
constituted to examine Alternate Risk management 
Mechanism under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima 
Yojana, the Operational Guidelines of the Scheme 
have further been revised with effect from Kharif 
2023 season.
The total funds released by Government of India 
during last 5 years and current years under various 
schemes for crop insurance are as under:
 
 
 
12.2  
Brief details of the crop insurance schemes 
being implemented in the country are given below:
12.2.1  Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana 
(PMFBY)
After detailed discussions with various stakeholders 
including State Governments, representatives of 
farmer organizations, Government of India had 
formulated the new Crop Insurance Scheme viz. 
Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), which is 
being implemented in various States/Union 
Territories of the country from Kharif 2016.  This 
scheme aims at supporting sustainable production in 
Agriculture sector by way of:


Providing financial support to farmers 
suffering crop loss/damage arising out of 
unforeseen events;


Stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure 
their continuance in farming;


Encouraging farmers to adopt innovative 
and modern agricultural practices;


Ensuring flow of credit to the agriculture 
sector; which will contribute to food 
security, crop diversification and enhancing 
growth and competitiveness of agriculture 
sector besides protecting farmers from 
production risks. 
133
12.2.2 Restructured Weather Based Crop 
Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS)
With the objective to provide coverage for those 
crops for which there is no standard/approved 
methodology for assessment of yield and to 
overcome the shortcoming under erstwhile NAIS, a 
pilot Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme 
(WBCIS) was launched in 20 States (as announced in 
the Union Budget 2007-08).  However, WBCIS was 
implemented as a full-fledged component scheme of 
the National Crop Insurance Programme (NCIP) from 
Rabi 2013-14 season to Rabi 2015-16. WBCIS 
intends to provide insurance protection to the 
farmers against adverse weather incidence, such as 
deficit and excess rainfall, high or low temperature, 
humidity etc. which are deemed to impact crop 
production adversely.  It has the advantage to settle 
claims within the shortest possible time.   The 
scheme has further been restructured on the basis of 
premium and administrative structure on the lines of 
PMFBY and is available in the country from Kharif 
2016 as Restructured WBCIS.
 The Schemes are being implemented through 20 
General Insurance Companies including all the 5 
Government Sector Companies.   Under PMFBY, a 
uniform maximum premium of only 2% of the sum 
insured is paid by farmers for Kharif and 1.5% for 
Rabi food and oilseed crops.   In case of annual 
commercial and horticultural crops, the maximum 
premium to be paid by farmers is upto 5%.  The 
premium rates to be paid by farmers are very low 
and uniform across the country and the balance of 
actuarial premium is being borne by the 
Government, to be shared equally by the State & 
Central Government, except in North Eastern States 
– from 2020-21 and Himalayan States – from 2023-
24, where the subsidy sharing pattern between 
Central and State Govt. is 90:10.   Key indicators on 
the scheme are given below :
 
i. 
1  Largest crop insurance scheme in the 
st
world in terms of farmer enrolments
 
ii. 3  Largest scheme in the World in terms of 
rd
insurance premiums.
 
iii. Currently implemented in 22 States/UTs, 
however the scheme has been implemented 
in 27 States/UTs in one or more seasons in 
last 7 years. 
 
iv. Farmer enrollment is estimated to increase 
by 23% in 2023-24 against 2022-23 and 
shall reach 3.75 - 4.0 crores with more than 
13 crore farmer applications for the year.
 
v. 
Since its inception in 2016, a total of 55.94 
crore farmer applications have been 
insured for a sum insured of more than Rs 
15.75 lakh crores (as on 31.10.2023).
 
vi. Since 2016, total claims amounting to Rs 
1.51 lakh crore against the farmers 
premium of Rs 30,800 crores have been 
paid, which is nearly 5 times of farmer 
premium collected.
 
vii. PMFBY has undergone major Technology 
and Operational changes to suit the crop- 
zone- & budgetary specific requirements of 
the States/UTs in last 1 year.
 
viii. States of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, 
Jharkhand, Telangana & West Bengal exited 
from the scheme during 2018-20 period, 
later Andhra Pradesh re-joined from Kharif 
2022. Jharkhand is likely to join from Kharif 
2024. Punjab never implemented the 
scheme. 
 
ix. Kerala has converged their own scheme 
with PMFBY, Goa is likely to converge their 
another scheme under PMFBY from next 
season, however both the states have been 
implem enting  PMFBY s ince 2 016 
continuously.
 
x. 
PMFBY is the only area-based scheme 
globally to leverage technology so 
extensively in its implementation. 
12.3. Major Achievements & Important Policy 
Decisions/activities taken
Alternative Risk Management Mechanisms 
(ARTM) developed by a committee of JS (Insurance), 
Department of Insurance (DFS) and Actuaries from 
the insurance industry has been approved and made 
available to states to choose from. 
Working Group headed by CEO, PMFBY was 
instrumental in getting Alternative Risk 
Management Models of Profit & Loss Sharing, Cup 
& Cap (60-130) & Cup & Cap (80-110) approved 
and passed through EFC giving flexibility to 
states to choose suitable model in addition to 
existing comprehensive insurance scheme under 
standard PMFBY. 
Annual Report 2023-24
134
This will on one hand help states with the multiple 
options to choose from as per their agriculture 
practices and agro-climatic requirements and on 
the other hand rationalize their fiscal expenditure 
on premium subsidies. The alternate models have 
been chosen by many states including, Madhya 
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, 
Tamil Nadu & Andhra Pradesh etc. in Kharif 2023 
and have led to considerable reduction in overall 
cost of premium and savings to Governments. 
NCIP (www.pmfby.gov.in)
a 
 has been developed as 
single source of Data for Actual Yield (AY) & 
Threshold Yield (TY) values for current and 
historical years in order to have a correct and 
similar data sets for Tendering and claim 
settlement. This has also enabled access to 
individual farmer-wise detailed data.  This has built 
trust based transparency in the scheme ecosystem 
and Insurers have responded with better pricing in 
the recently concluded tendering cycle. 
Digi-Claim-Payment Module 
All PMFBY claim calculation and settlement shall 
now be done through Digi-Claim module of National 
Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) using Public Finance 
Management System (PFMS) Platform. Now Govt. 
will have visibility of quantum of eligible claims, 
claims paid by the Insurance Company and actual 
claims transferred to beneficiary farmers, which till 
now was missing and Govt. always had dependence 
for these reports and data on Insurance Company.
More than Rs. 9,000 Crs. of claims for 50.47 lakh 
beneficiaries have been transacted through the 
module since its launch in March 2023.
AIDE (App for Intermediary Enrolment):
In addition to the existing channels of enrollment 
for non-loanee farmers viz. CSC, Banks, Post Offices 
etc, a smart-phone App has been designed and 
rolled out in Kharif 2023 for enrollment of farmers 
at their door-steps through a large network of 
Insurance Intermediaries. This App has been 
designed to streamline the process of enrollment 
and offer a completely paper-less and cash-less 
experience to a farmer to get enrolled leveraging the 
digital technology for registration, documentation 
and premium payment. 
Already approx. 2.76 Lakhs applications covering 
about 1.23 lakh Ha area have been done during 
Kharif 2023.
Krishi Rakshak Portal & Helpline: 
A single toll-free phone number integrated 
grievance redressal mechanism having digital 
portal and a call centre has been developed to 
enable farmers to lodge their grievances/ 
concerns/queries. This Krishi Rakshak Portal & 
Helpline was launched on pilot basis for 
Chhattisgarh in July 2022, it shall be graduated to 
the nation-wide roll-out.
It shall be dovetailed with National Crop Insurance 
Portal and integrated with all stakeholders for real-
time tracing, monitoring and redressal of 
grievances and queries.
Digitized land record integration is another 
intervention to ensure deduplication of land parcels 
and uniquely identify the land parcels of insured 
farmers thereby ensuring rationalization of 
premium subsidies and genuine utilization of 
scheme benefits. 
Land Records of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka 
& Odisha were already integrated with NCIP. In 2022-
23, land records of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, 
Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu & Haryana have been 
integrated this year. With this, the scheme has 
reached to more than 90% Insured Area being pre-
validated through digital e-land records.
Discussions with other states including Uttar 
Pradesh & Himachal Pradesh are already in 
advanced stage. 
Mechanism of Escrow Account for states to ensure 
that the premium subsidies payments are not 
delayed beyond the prescribed timelines as per 
provisions of Operational Guidelines. NCIP to be 
opened up for enrollments only after commitments 
of states in terms of deposit of premium liability into 
Escrow Account. 
 12.4.       New Technologies
Under PMFBY, CCEs have increased manifold. Every 
year around 70 lakh CCEs need to be conducted to 
arrive at yield data within a short harvesting window 
of 15-20 days is a challenging task.  With the primary 
objective to reduce the delays in claim payment to 
farmers, efforts have been made to make the scheme 
technology driven.  Capturing of CCEs data on 
smartphones/CCE Agri App and its real-time transfer 
on the National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) has 
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
135
been made mandatory from Kharif 2017 to ensure 
transparency and real time transfer of data. Remote 
sensing is being used to rationalize the number of 
Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) at unit area level.   
This Department has conducted large scale pilot 
studies through technology organizations 
(Government/ private/ national/ international) to 
estimate crop yield at village/GP level using 
innovative technologies.   Smart Sampling and Two 
Step Yield Estimation has been adopted under 
PMFBY implementation to rationalize and reduce 
number of CCEs to be conducted. This will ensure 
reduction in CCE numbers without impacting quality 
of sampling and yield estimation results.    Further, 
after detailed analysis of the technology driven 
approaches developed during pilot studies for Gram 
Panchayat (GP) level crop yield estimation in Kharif 
2019,  Rabi 2019-20 for Rabi 2020-21 Government 
has approved following three major initiatives from 
Kharif 2023 onward :
12.4.1 YES-Tech (Yield Estimation based on 
Technology) is a technology based yield 
estimations mechanism which has been developed 
after 2 years of rigorous testing and pilot runs 
across 100 districts of the country. It does crop Loss 
assessment and Yield estimation assisted by data 
inputs from sources such as Remote Sensing 
indices, Weather indices, crop phenological 
information, soil types etc. MNCFC in collaboration 
with other experts has  approved 5 Technologies/ 
Approaches for adoption for Paddy and Wheat 
crops from Kharif 2023 onwards.
Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh were the first 
states to implement YESTECH from Kharif 2022, 8 
more major states have given consent for adopting 
YESTECH from Kharif 2023 onwards with minimum 
30% threshold for technology driven yield 
estimation. The guidelines of the same have been 
issued to the all concerned and are also available on 
NCIP. Ten States namely, Assam, Haryana, Rajasthan, 
Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, 
Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu & Karnataka & Odisha 
shall be implementing Yes-Tech in this year. 
Pilot study has also been undertaken for non-cereal 
crops during Kharif 2022 and Rabi 2022-23.    
Results are being analysed by experts in the field.  
Based on the results/analysis of these pilots more 
crops will be included for yield estimation through 
technology. 
12.4.2  WINDS (Weather Information Network & 
Data System) is a pioneering initiative of the 
country to set-up a network of Automatic Weather 
Stations & Rain Gauges. It will entail the installation 
of one AWS  at Taluk/Block level and  one ARG at the 
Gram Panchayat level to create a strong database of 
hyper-local weather data for the different Govt. and 
other entities to use for all farmer and farming 
oriented services. The data so collected will be used 
for claim assessment under Parametric Crop 
Annual Report 2023-24
136
insurance, Yield estimation through Technology, 
Crop-Region specific Agriculture Advisories to the 
Farmers, Disaster Risk Resilience & Mitigation 
needs. As of now the country has approx. 13,000 
AWS and 20,000 ARGs installed for all institutions 
including IMD. Under WINDS, an additional 3,500 
AWS and Approx. 1.6 lakh ARGs are proposed to be 
established across the country. IMD and DA&FW 
has collaborated for setting up this system.
Nine states namely, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, 
Rajas than, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, 
Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala & Karnataka 
shall be implementing WINDS in this year.
12.4.3 CROPIC (Collection of Real time 
observations and Photographs of Crops) is an 
initiative which has been taken up for periodic 
collection of photographs of crops during the crop 
life cycle. System is being put in place to collect 3-4 
photographs of crops during their growth cycle. 
These photographs will be used for validation of 
sown and insured crops, crop damage assessment 
at the time of any localized and wide-spread 
calamity or climatic condition affecting the crops 
and also act as an input for Technology based yield 
estimation models. 
A small-scale pilot was also launched to do a 
computer vision technology-based crop-damage 
assessment using photo-analytics, results of the 
same are looking promising. Based on these results, 
a large scale pilot to test the technology across crops 
and states will be done in this year to validate the 
technology and adopt the same under PMFBY. 
EoI for invitation of proposals for implementation 
of photo-analytics based crop damage assessment 
has been published.
A thorough consultative process with all 
stakeholders was adopted to have inputs on the 
same. This intervention is well accepted by the 
insurance industry and reciprocated well in terms of 
increased participation in tenders and reduced 
premium rates in recently concluded tendering cycle.
 12.5.       Tender Cycle 2023-25:
In the current tender cycle for 2023-2025, 4 old left-
out insurers have started participating, additionally 
2 more insurers have been empanelled and 
therefore we have number of insurers increasing 
from 11 in 2020 tendering cycle to 15 in current 
year's tender cycle.
In the current tender cycle, a large participation of 
Insurance companies and high level of competition 
in bidding has been witnessed, which has led to 
discovery of very competitive premium rates. An 
overall reduction of 32%-35% in premium rates has 
been witnessed in comparison to rates in the 
previous years. This reduction has led to a 
combined saving of Govt. liabilities of Rs. 10,500 
Crores in comparison to 2020-21 for the state & 
Central Govts.
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare

In 2022-23 crops seasons:
 
 
o 
Non-loanee farmers enrolment has 
increased to 42% of the total Farmers 
enrolled from 28% in 2022-23.
 
 
o 
Overall enrollment of farmers have 
increased by 21%, i.e. number of 
farmers enrolled in 2022-23 have 
reached more than 3.16 Crores against 
2.61 crore farmers in 2021-22.
 
 
o 
Overall insured area has also increased 
by 12% in comparison to 2021-22 and 
reached at more than 497 Lakh Ha. 
This has resulted in insurance 
coverage of 32% of gross Cropped Area 
of Implementing  states/UTs, which in 
2021-22 was at 30%.
Expected coverage for 2023-24 seasons:
 
 
o 
Non-Loanee farmers are expected to 
be 42%-45% 
 
 
o 
Overall enrolment of farmers to 
increase by 23%, i.e. total farmers 
enrolled are expected to reach 3.75-
4.00 Crs 
 
 
o 
Overall insured area to increase 18% to 
5.75 – 6.00 Cr. Hectares from existing 
4.97 Cr. Hectares.

Progress of the scheme implementation
       
    
The Scheme has completed 7 years of its 
implementation.  Due to the concerted efforts of the 
Government coverage under the scheme as 
compared to erstwhile schemes has been increased.  
Season-wise and Year-wise details of coverage 
including claims (as on 31.10.2023) are given in the 
following table:
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
139
In spite of overall good monsoon during the first 
four years of implementation of PMFBY, the claim 
ratio was about 77.5%, 90%, 99.5% and 86.5% in 
2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 
respectively.
Moreover, the farmers in most affected States 
received higher claims and the claim ratio  i.e. 
claims over gross premium collected by insurance 
companies in the State was high in the following 
States : 
Under PMFBY, benefits to the farmers are also being 
provided through early payment of claims directly 
into the bank accounts of the farmers. To bring more 
transparency in assessment of crop losses and 
assessment  & settlement of claims through use of 
technology etc. a Digiclaim module has been 
introduced on NCIP. 
Text SMS is being sent to all loanee farmers whose 
mobile numbers have been entered on the portal.  
Acknowledgement receipt is being generated on the 
portal and made available to banks.  All farmers who 
are enrolling through CSCs or directly on the crop 
insurance portal are being provided physical 
receipt at the time of enrolment. Acknowledgement 
receipt is being provided to all loanee farmers from 
Kharif 2018 season through “Meri Policy Mere 
Haath” campaign.
12.7. Review of Operational Guidelines of the 
Scheme and issue of Revised Guidelines
The schemes' implementation is reviewed/ 
monitored constantly through weekly video 
conferences, one to one meeting with the 
stakeholders on a regular basis and the National 
Level Monitoring Committee (NLMC). Learning from 
the Scheme implementation experience, an extensive 
consultative exercise with all implementing partners 
was made and Operational Guidelines (OGs) of 
PMFBY/RWBCIS were revised with effect from  1  
st
October, 2018 from Rabi 2018-19  season and further 
revamped from Kharif 2020 season.
Based on the report of Working Group constituted to 
examine Alternate Risk management Mechanism 
under PMFBY and Impact study of the Scheme, the 
Operational Guidelines of the Scheme have further 
been reviewed and revised w.e.f. Kharif 2023 
season.
12.8.  Coverage of Women Farmers under 
PMFBY
All farmers, whether sharecroppers, tenant 
farmers, including women farmers growing crops in 
the areas notified by the concerned State/UT 
Government, are eligible for coverage under the 
Annual Report 2023-24
140
scheme and can insure themselves as per 
provisions of the scheme. The coverage under the 
scheme is subject to land records and tenancy 
contracts.  Further, the Scheme is demand-driven. 
Since the scheme has been made voluntary for 
participation, all farmers, including woman 
farmers, are eligible to enroll under the scheme.  
The scheme has no specific extra benefits/ 
provisions for women farmers.  However, the 
Government is bound to pay its share in premium 
subsidies for all the farmers, including women 
who take up crop insurance. 
The coverage of women farmers under PMFBY has 
remained consistent since the inception of the 
scheme. Over the last three seasons, mainly Rabi 
2021-22, Kharif 22 and Kharif 22-23, out of the total 
coverage under the scheme, approximately 15%-
16% of women farmers were enrolled under the 
scheme every year. The State of Maharashtra has 
achieved maximum enrolment of women farmers 
till 2020-21 in terms of quantum of application-
wise enrolments, constituting almost 18%-19% of 
the State's total farmer coverage. However, over the 
last two years, i.e., 2021-22 & 2022-23, the 
maximum quantum of application-wise enrolments 
for women farmers have come from the State of 
Rajasthan, constituting nearly 12-13% of the State's 
total farmer coverage. 
The insured area owned by women farmers in the 
State of Maharashtra has been the highest among all 
participating States until 2020-21, whereas during 
2021-22 and 2022-23 area insured by women 
farmers has been highest in the State of Rajasthan. 
Union Territories and North East States have 
recorded fairly improved enrolment of women 
farmers over the years.
For the latest two seasons i.e., Rabi 2022-23 and 
Kharif 2022-23, we have witnessed an increment of 
36% & 48% respectively in overall applications 
enrolled by women farmers over previous seasons. 
In detailed specs, Loanee Women farmer 
applications have increased by 65% both in the 
Kharif and Rabi seasons of 2022-23. As regards 
Non-Loanee farmer applications, an increment of

Overview
13.1 
Under the vision of the Government, this 
department has taken many policy initiatives to 
strengthen the farm credit delivery system to 
provide credit at lower interest rates to support the 
agricultural sector's resource requirements. These 
policies have emphasised providing timely and 
adequate credit support to farmers, focusing on 
small and marginal farmers and weaker sections of 
society, enabling them to adopt modern technology 
and improved agricultural practices to increase 
agricultural production and productivity. The policy 
aims at augmenting credit flow at the ground level 
through credit planning, adoption of region-specific 
strategies, rationalisation of lending policies and 
procedures and bringing down the rate of interest 
on farm loans.
13.2
Policy initiatives for increasing the flow 
 
of credit
The government has initiated several measures to 
galvanise the institutional credit system to make it 
more responsive to the needs of farmers. Some of 
the critical measures undertaken in this regard are 
as follows:-
13.2.1 Agriculture Credit: Target and 
 
Achievement
The government sets a target for agricultural credit 
flow every year, which has increased consistently 
over the years, and it reached Rs. 21,55,163 crore 
against the target of Rs.18,50,000 crore during 
2022-23. The target for 2023-24 has been fixed at 
Rs.20,00,000 crore. The credit flow trends since 
2014-15 is shared below
 
 
13.2.2   Modified Interest Subvention Scheme
 
The Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) was launched 
in 2006-07 to provide concessional short-term crop 
loans, including loans availed through Kisan Credit 
Card (KCC) to the farmers. The scheme has been 
renamed the Modified Interest Subvention Scheme 
(MISS) for 2021-22.
MISS is available to farmers availing short-term agri 
loans up to Rs.3.00 lakh at an interest rate of 7% per 
annum for one year. The short-term agri loans 
include crop husbandry, animal husbandry, dairy 
farming, and fisheries. An additional 3% prompt 
repayment incentive (PRI) is also given to the 
farmers for prompt and timely repayment of loans; 
the same gets reduced to 4% per annum. The 
143
benefits of MISS can be availed by farmers in allied 
activities like Animal Husbandry and Fisheries who 
already possess KCC within the overall limit of 
Rs.3.00 lakh. New KCC can be issued to Animal 
Husbandry and Fisheries farmers with the 
provision of the benefit of IS & PRI for loan amounts 
up to Rs. 2.00 lakh per annum. Interest subvention 
and prompt repayment incentive on restructured 
crop loans to farmers affected by severe natural 
calamities for a maximum period of 5 years based 
on the report of Inter-Ministerial Central Team 
(IMCT) for grant of NDRF assistance and Sub-
Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-
NEC) is also available. Further, IS is available to 
Small and Marginal Farmers (SMFs) having Kisan 
Credit Card (KCC) on post-harvest loans against 
Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (NWRs), i.e. at the 
same rates as applicable to crop loans for a period of 
up to six months post-harvest.
During the financial year 2022-23, the Department 
released a sum of Rs. 17,997.886 crore to the 
implementing agencies, i.e. Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) / National Bank for Agriculture and Rural 
Development (NABARD), as a subsidy under the 
Interest Subvention Scheme. The government has 
allocated a sum of Rs. 23,000 crore (RE - Rs. 18,500 
crore) for the current financial year for interest 
subsidy under the scheme. Out of the current year 
budget, Rs. 12,859.42 crore has been released to 
RBI/NABARD under the scheme. Details of funds 
released during the last five years and the current 
financial year are as follows:
13.2.3 Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC)
KCC was introduced in 1998 to provide timely credit 
to farmers to meet short-term/long-term cultivation 
requirements, post-harvest expenses, consumption 
requirements, etc. KCC is implemented by 
Commercial Banks, Cooperative Banks and Rural 
Regional Banks (RRBs) under the overall guidance of 
the Department of Financial Services. Reserve Bank 
of India issued a master circular on implementing the 
KCC scheme, followed by more instructions 
occasionally.
This Ministry is actively involved in promoting KCC 
scheme to provide farmers easy access to 
concessional institutional credit. Several steps have 
been taken to simplify the procedure to access KCC. 
The KCC scheme, along with the benefit of IS & PRI 
has been extended to farmers practising animal 
husbandry and fisheries. Processing fees, inspection, 
ledger folio charges, and all other service charges 
have been waived for fresh issues/renewal of KCC. 
Collateral free agriculture loan limit has been raised 
from Rs.1.00 lakh to Rs.1.60 lakh. Standardised 
application form for KCC has been designed for easy 
understanding of farmers.
To bring the maximum number of farmers under KCC 
so that they can get loans at a cheaper rate through 
the MISS scheme, the government has been running a 
campaign for saturation of KCC to farmers since 
February 2019. The Govt. (DA&FW and DFS) has 
further taken up the task of covering 2.5 crore 
farmers under KCC in a mission mode. Since February 
2020, a renewed saturation drive has been run to 
cover eligible and willing farmers with a particular 
focus on PM KISAN beneficiaries. As a result, as of 29-
12-2023, 463.12 lakh new KCC applications have 
been sanctioned with a sanctioned credit limit of Rs. 
5,66,903 crore as part of the drive.
A revised KCC Saturation drive, i.e. "Ghar Ghar KCC 
Abhiyan", is being launched with a special focus on 
saturating PM KISAN beneficiaries from 01st 
October 23 to 31st December 23. The main 
objective of this drive is to mobilise the potential 
farmers through a campaign under the Block Level 
Bankers Committee to saturate PM KISAN 
beneficiaries with KCC and to enrol a maximum 
number of farmers/PM KISAN beneficiaries under 
all types of KCC schemes (for Crop cultivation, 
Animal Husbandry, Dairy and Fisheries etc.). A 
periodic review of "Ghar Ghar KCC Abhiyan" will be 
done by GoI and State/District/Block level 
fortnightly, weekly, and monthly at different stages.

13.2.4 Kisan Rin Portal
Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare 
(DA&FW), Govt. of India, in cooperation with the 
Department of Financial Services (DFS), 
Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying 
(DAH&D), Department of Fisheries (DoF), RBI and 
NABARD, has developed an integrated digital portal 
viz. 'Kisan Rin Portal' for KCC & MISS to have 
complete access to the granular data of farmers/ 
borrowers of KCC, including information about 
loans sanctioned and eligible interest subvention 
claims of the banks and review and monitoring of 
scheme progress & utilisation and to intervene with 
policy level strategic interventions and guidelines 
to make the scheme more resilient, focused, 
beneficial and efficient. Hon'ble Minister of Finance 
& Corporate Affairs and Hon'ble Agriculture 
Minister have launched 'Kisan Rin Portal' on 19  
th
September, 2023.
Since banks play a crucial role in extending short-
term seasonal Agriculture Loans to farmers for their 
capital requirements, it is felt that integrating the 
banks with the Kisan Rin Portal being developed by 
the Department will be of utmost importance to 
have a granular, hassle-free, and informative data 
available to the Department. The portal is now 
ready for data entry of claims related to MISS for the 
FY 2021-22 and 2022-23, and most of the banks are 
already onboarded.
In this connection, all the banks have already been 
requested to plan and deploy necessary 
development/ middleware for enabling requisite 
electronic data sharing with Govt. of India at the 
earliest and complete the data exchange / sharing 
within given timelines so that Aadhaar 
authenticated data of all KCC is fed into the portal. 
NABARD was requested to complete the KCC portal 
data entry by 
 (RRBs) and 
Regional Rural Banks
Cooperative Banks. All the public sector banks were 
also asked to complete the data entry/exchange 
(Fully digital/Hybrid/Manual) on the Kisan Rin 
portal. A timely review of the progress regarding the 
"Data Exchange of KCC beneficiaries on the Kisan 
Rin portal" is being done jointly by this Department 
and the Department of Financial Services.

Overview 
 
The Government has been playing a pivotal role in 
developing Agriculture Marketing system in the 
country. Agricultural Marketing Division of 
Department of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare 
(DA&FW) is entrusted to look after a gamut of issues 
relating to agricultural marketing, starting from 
conceptualization and formulation of farmers 
oriented policies and programmes to effective 
monitoring thereof for proper and efficient  
implementation.

linkage between the farm production, the retail chain 
and food processing industries. In order to remove 
restrictive and monopolistic practices of present 
marketing system, reduce the intermediaries in 
supply chain, reduce wastages by way of promoting 
integrated supply and value chain and to benefit 
farmers through access to global markets, reforms in 
agricultural markets have to be perceived as an 
ongoing process. Agriculture sector needs 
competitive and well- functioning markets for 
farmers to sell their produce. There is a need to 
enhance private sector investment in development of 
post- harvest marketing infrastructure for which 
various schemes are also implemented by Govt. of 
India.

Achievements:
 
Agri Marketing Reforms: 
 
 Since the circulation of model APMC Act in 

2003, Division has been vigorously pursuing 
with the States to adopt its provisions. Many 
of the States made cosmetic partial reforms 
leading to no noticeable ground level 
development excepting in few States like 
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan 
and Madhya Pradesh, have not only 
amended their marketing laws and put in 
place conducive atmosphere but have also 
made reform linked noticeable progress. 
 
 In order to make model APMC Act, 2003 

more holistic, comprehensive and farmers 
friendly, Marketing Division in consultation 
with NITI Aayog and States formulated and 
released model Act “The --- State/ UT 
Agricultural Produce and Livestock 
Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 
2017”, popularly called model APLM Act, in 
April, 2017. The essence of the model APLM 
Act, 2017 is to provide complete freedom to 
the cultivators and livestock rearers to sell 
their produce, livestock and its product to 
the buyers and through the marketing 
channel of their choice offering the better 
bids. 
Annual Report 2023-24
164
 
 De-regulation of marketing of Fruits & 

Vegetables – Existing marketing system of 
fruits & vegetables through network of 
APMC markets is attributed towards high 
post-harvest losses, long intermediation in 
supply chain and low return to the farmers. 
In order to address this issue, Department 
has been advocating with the States to 
provide complete freedom to the farmers as 
well as buyers and investors to invest in 
development of marketing infrastructure 
and supply chain outside the market yards so 
as to facilitate emergence of various 
channels of marketing. Most of the states 
have adopted this provision, though in 
varied form.
 
 Considering the importance of integrating 

farmers including fruits and vegetable 
growers with agro-industries with the 
objectives to mitigate market and price 
uncertainties, reduce post-harvest losses 
and create rural employment, Department 
formulated and released a model Act; “The -
-- State/ UT Agricultural Produce and 
Livestock Contract Farming & Services 
(Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018”. The 
model Act not only provides the facilitative 
eco-system for contract produce output but 
also for services all along the agri. food 
value chain starting from pre-harvest, 
harvest and post- harvest including 
marketing. Marketing Division has been 
pursuing with the states to adopt it.
(a) Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure 
(AMI):
 
 Since inception of scheme up to 31.12.2023, 

a total number of 47,231 storage 
infrastructure projects (Godowns), with 
storage capacity of 89.67 million MT were 
sanctioned under the scheme and subsidy 
of Rs. 4212.45 crore has been released. 
Similarly, 20,298 other marketing 
infrastructure projects have also been 
sanctioned and subsidy of Rs. 2012.88 crore 
has been released so far.
 
 The estimation during the period Jan'2024 

to March'24 under AMI scheme is as

Major Success Stories during FY 2023-24 (till 
Sept'23)
1. Andhra Pradesh
Inter- State trade Success story
In September, the Maharashtra Board granted an 
exemption from the requirement of a Bank 
Guarantee for Trader License. They also issued free 
license and waived the market fee for onion trade. In 
Andhra Pradesh, the e-NAM team and the AP 
Marketing Department organized a meeting with 
onion traders to facilitate onion trade from 
Maharashtra. Traders from three APMCs - 
Ravulapalem, Guntur, and Eluru APMCs - expressed 
their interest and applied for licenses. 
Subsequently, the e-NAM team issued licenses to 
these traders.
In September 2023, six traders from Ravulapalem, 
Guntur, and Eluru APMCs participated in interstate 
trade. The highest volume of inter-state trade 
within Andhra Pradesh involved 2722.5 metric tons 
of commodities valued at 475 lakhs.
Traders are delighted with the new opportunity to 
engage in interstate trade through the e-NAM 
portal. It is expected that this trend will continue in 
the future, further promoting interstate trade.

1. Gujarat
Breaking Barriers: Gujarat Amendment bill passed 
for change in APMC act for Interstate Trade through 
e-NAM
Gujarat's journey in promoting interstate trade 
through e-NAM is an inspiring success story. The 
state recognized the need for change and embarked 
on a path to unlock new opportunities for its traders 
and farmers. The key to this transformation was an 
amendment to the APMC (Agricultural Produce 
Market Committee) Act, enabling Gujarat traders to 
buy and sell agricultural produce with their 
counterparts in other states.
The pivotal moment in this narrative came when the 
amendment to the APMC Act was passed in the 
Minister Cabinet. This decision marked a significant 
shift in the state's approach to agricultural trade, 
fostering a more inclusive and expansive 
marketplace.
With this change in place, Gujarat traders will gain 
the privilege of a unified license, allowing them to 
seamlessly participate in interstate trade through e-
NAM. The impact was profound, as it will eliminate 
the previous barriers that hindered cross-border 
transactions.
The success of this initiative is a testament to 
Gujarat's commitment to economic growth and 
innovation. By embracing e-NAM and facilitating 
interstate trade, the state not only empowered its 
traders but also enhanced the prospects of its 
farmers.
Gujarat's traders could now connect with a broader 
network of buyers and sellers, making the 
agricultural marketplace more competitive and 
efficient.
Gujarat's success story in interstate trade through e-
NAM is a shining example of how a forward-thinking 
policy change can revolutionize the agricultural 
sector. By embracing technology and amending the 
APMC Act, the state has created a win-win situation, 
driving economic growth and prosperity for its 
traders, farmers, and consumers. This story 
demonstrates the power of bold initiatives in 
transforming age-old systems for the better.
Interstate Trade on E-NAM: Enhancing Agricultural 
Commerce between Gujarat and Maharashtra
NAM, the Electronic National Agriculture Market, 
has become a transformative platform for 
facilitating interstate trade and boosting 
agricultural commerce. One noteworthy example of 
this success is the collaboration between Gujarat 
and Maharashtra in the exchange of agricultural 
products.
 
Annual Report 2023-24
180
In this thriving partnership, e-NAM has played a 
pivotal role in facilitating the sale of onions by 
NAFED (National Agricultural Cooperative 
Marketing Federation of India). Onions, a staple in 
Indian households, are grown in abundance in 
Maharashtra's Lasalgaon APMC (Agricultural 
Produce Market Committee) and Gujarat's Mahuva 
and Gondal APMCs. E-NAM provides a seamless and 
transparent avenue for NAFED to connect with 
buyers and sell their onion produce across state 
borders. This not only streamlines the distribution 
process but also ensures fair pricing and 
accessibility to consumers.
Another noteworthy example of interstate trade 
through E-NAM involves the exchange of sunflower 
seeds between Gujarat and Maharashtra. Nizar 
APMC in Gujarat and Nandurbar APMC in 
Maharashtra have fostered a successful trade 
partnership. E-NAM has served as the bridge, 
connecting sellers and buyers from these regions 
and facilitating the exchange of sunflower seeds. 
This collaboration promotes economic growth and 
diversification in both states and strengthens the 
agricultural supply chain.

Success Story: Interstate Trade of Silk Cocoon 
from APMC Baramati, Maharashtra
NAM is national level platform is being 
developed by the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Farmer Welfare, implemented through SFAC. In 
Baramati APMC, the e-NAM basically increases 
the choice of the farmer when he brings his 
produce to the mandi for sale. Local traders can 
bid for the produce and also traders on the 
electronic platform sitting in other States. 
APMC Baramati gives the farmer choice to 
accept or reject the bid rate he gets.
APMC had made arrangements to see visuals on 
big screen, in which live bidding and rates are 
seen, this makes farmers easily to decide and 
mark status of his lots. e-NAM platform provides 
better price compare with MSP and private 
markets. Earlier to e-NAM traders used to form 
syndicate and quote lesser price. However, after 
the implementation of e-NAM, as the prices are 
disseminated in transparent manner, he 
receives good price for his produce. Not only the 
local trader but buyers from other state like 
Kerala and Karnataka are taking part in bidding, 
hence rate received is very competitive.
Interstate Trade conducted till 28-10-2023; 
Traded Value – 147.62 Qtl
Traded Volume – Rs 84.20Lakhs

Agriculture Trade Policy, Promotion and Logistics 
Development Division of this Department is 
entrusted with the responsibility of making policy 
recommendations on export, import and logistics 
development of agriculture sector and formulation 
of strategy for boosting international trade in Agri 
commodities. It is the nodal Division of the 
Department for coordinating/formulating 
responses on World Trade Organization's (WTO) 
Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), matters relating 
to Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs)/Free 
Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the Department of 
Commerce (DoC), matters relating to the 
modification in the Custom duty and Goods and 
Services Tax (GST) on agricultural commodities 
with the Department of Revenue (DoR).
15.2  
India's Agriculture Trade
15.2.1   Agri-Export:
Export of agricultural commodities has helped 
producers to take advantage of wider international 
market which, in turn, has incentivized their 
domestic production. Crops exported in large 
quantities viz. rice, sugar, and spices have witnessed 
significant increase in area coverage and growth 
rate of production. In the year 2022-23, India has 
emerged as a significant Agri-exporter in crops like 
marine products, buffalo meat, rice, sugar, spices, oil 
meals, wheat, castor oil and misc. processed items . 
As per available WTO's Trade Statistical Review 
(2023), the share of India's agricultural exports and 
imports in the world agriculture trade in 2022 were 
2.4% and 1.9%, respectively. India was in the top 10 
ranking of the global Agri exporters.
The share of agricultural exports in India's total 
merchandise exports has decreased from 11.90% in 
2021-22, to 11.79% in 2022-23.
As compared to previous year (2021-22), the Agri 
and Allied exports in the year 2022-23 increased by 
13.90% to Rs. 4,26,693.20 crores. The increase in 
Agri and Allied exports during 2022-23 was 
primarily on account of increased exports of 
commodities like Cashew Nut Shell Liquid 
(249.03%), Vegetable Oils (114.93%), Poultry 
Products (104.10%), Pulses (98.01%), Oil Meals 
(68.26%), Tobacco Unmanufactured (55.31%), 
Guergam Meal (48%), Rice Basmoti (45.98%), 
Groundnut (43.39%) and Sugar (34.84%) which 
witnessed high growth in the year 2022-23 as 
compared to previous same period. 
Major destinations of exports for India's Agri and 
Allied commodities were USA, UAE, Saudi Arabia, 
China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Iran and Bangladesh.
 
 
 
186
15.2.2  Agri-Imports:
 
As compared to previous year (2021-22), the Agri 
and allied imports in the year 2022-23 increased by 
18.27% to Rs 282890.08 crore. Increase in value of 
Agri and Allied imports during 2022-23 were 
primarily on account of increase in imports of 
Wheat (25895.12%), Sesame Seeds (271.22%), 
Guergam Meal (255.37%), Sheep/Goat Meat 
(250.16%), Shellac (242.58%), Other Cereals 
(210.06%), Cotton Raw including waste (175.97%), 
Mollases (131.45%), Sugar (88.25%) and Jute Raw 
(84.75%). Similarly, the total merchandise imports 
increased more significantly, therefore the share of 
Agri and Allied imports has increased from 5.23% in 
2021-22 to 6.43% in 2022-23.
Major sources of import of India's Agri and Allied 
commodities are Indonesia, Malaysia, Argentina, 
Ukraine, United States of America, Brazil, Nepal, 
Thailand, Myanmar, Singapore, Afghanistan, 
Tanzania, Vietnam, United Arab Emirates, 
Bangladesh, China, Canada, Netherlands, Sri Lanka 
and Australia.
 
India's top 10 agricultural export commodities (in terms of value) for the year 2018-19 to 2022-23 are given in

Chapter-16
16.1    Overview
Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) was launched 
as a flagship scheme of the Department of Agriculture 
& Farmers' Welfare (DA&FW) in 2007-2008 to 
incentivize States to draw up comprehensive 
agriculture development plans, taking into account 
agro-climatic conditions, natural resources and 
technology for ensuring more inclusive and 
integrated development of agriculture and allied 
sectors. The scheme was implemented as a State Plan 
Scheme till the end of the financial year 2013-14 and 
is being implemented as a CSS (State Plan) scheme 
thereafter. In accordance with the directions of the 
Ministry of Finance, the funding pattern of the 
scheme from 2015-16 onwards has been altered 
from 100% funding by the Central Government to in 
the ratio of 60:40 between the Centre and States and 
90:10 for North-Eastern and Himalayan States. 
However, funding pattern to UTs continued to be as 
100% by the Central Government.
The Scheme has been revamped as the Rashtriya 
Krishi Vikas Yojana - Remunerative Approaches for 
Agriculture and Allied Sector Rejuvenation (RKVY-
RAFTAAR) for implementation from 2017-18 with a 
major focus on pre & post-harvest infrastructure, 
besides   promoting   agri-entrepreneurship, 
innovations   & value addition   with   the approval of 
the Union Cabinet on 01.11.2017. A State Level 
Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) constituted under the 
chairmanship of the Chief Secretary of the concerned 
State/UT is empowered to approve projects under 
the scheme. The State Agriculture Department is the 
nodal Department for implementation of the scheme 
in the State. The scheme is available for the various 
activities of agriculture & allied sector such as crop 
developm ent, horticulture, agricultural 
mechanization, marketing, pre & post-harvest 
management, integrated pest management, organic 
farming, research, extension etc.
As per recommendation of Expenditure Finance 
Committee, RKVY has been re-structured as RKVY 
Cafeteria Scheme from 2022-23 onwards merging 
some schemes of Department of Agriculture & 
Farmers Welfare which includes Soil Health & 
Fertility (SHF), Rainfed Area Development (RAD), 
Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Per Drop 
More Crop (PDMC), Agriculture Mechanization 
(including Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization 
and Management of Crop Residue (CRM), Agro 
Forestry and  Crop Diversification Programme. RKVY 
cafeteria scheme has 3 components viz. Annual 
Action Plan (AAP), Detailed Project Report (DPR) and 
Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation including 
startup. 
16.2 Objectives of RKVY scheme
. 
The objectives of the scheme are:
 
i. 
To strengthen the efforts of farmers through 
creation of pre & post-harvest agricultural 
infrastructure that increases access to quality 
inputs, storage, market facilities etc and 
enables farmers to make informed choice.
 
ii. To provide autonomy, flexibility to States to 
plan and execute schemes as per local/ 
farmers' needs. 
 
iii. To promote value chain addition linked 
production models for increase in the 
farmer's income as well as encourage 
production/productivity
 
iv. To mitigate the risk of farmers with focus on 
additional income generation activities - 
integrated farming, mushroom cultivation, 
bee keeping, aromatic plant cultivation, 
floriculture etc.
 
v. 
To em power y ou th through s kill 
development, innovation and agri-
entrepreneurship based agribusiness 
models. 
16.3 Funding pattern under RKVY: 
RKVY fund is provided to the States/UTS as 
 
 
 
191
grant-in-aid. The cost norms specified in various 
Central Government Schemes of Department of 
Agriculture, & Farmers Welfare (DA&FW), and 
other Ministries will be applicable for the 
activities/components to be supported under 
DPR based component of RKVY. The state-wise 
allocation and release of funds and the sector-
wise cost of projects approved by States under 
the scheme during the last two years and current 
year (as on date) are given respectively at 
annexures - 16.1 & 16.2.
16.4 Innovation & Agri-Entrepreneurship 
programme:  
A new progamme called ”Innovation 
and Agri-Entrepreneurship Development” has 
been launched under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana 
in 2018-19 with the objective to promote 
innovation and agripreneurship by providing 
financial support and nurturing the incubation 
ecosystem. Start-ups pertaining to agriculture and 
allied sectors are being   encouraged in order to 
contribute directly and indirectly to enhancing the 
income of farmers by providing opportunities to 
them and to provide employment to youth. In this 
connection, five (5) Knowledge Partners (KPs) and 
twenty four (24) Agribusiness Incubators (R-ABIs) 
have been appointed by this Department to advise 
on smooth and efficient execution of this 
programme in various States across the country.
Over 3500 entrepreneurs / agripreneurs have been 
trained during 2019-20 to 2023-24  under Agri-
entrepreneurship programme. Out of these trained 
entrepreneurs, 1524 start-ups operating in various 
areas of agriculture & allied sectors have been given 
financial support. A sum of Rs. 106.25 crore has 
been released in installments to the respective KPs 
and RABIs for funding to these start-ups.  
A Management Information System (MIS) has been 
developed and launched for monitoring the progress 
of implementation of Agri-Entreprenurship 
Programme of RKVY by KPs and R-ABIs. The link of 
portal is 
. All KPs and R-
http://rkvystartups.nic.in
ABIs are required to upload information on various 
parameters of this programme on MIS portal for 
transparency. 
16.5. Success Stories
Some of the success stories reported by the States 
under RKVY scheme and by Agri business 
Incubators under Agri-Entrepreneurship 
Programme of RKVY are given as under:
I.  Title: Establishment of Permanent Pandal 
 
System (RKVY)
Category: Horticulture/ Agriculture
Background & objectives:
Pandal system is a technological improvement used 
to support bitter gourd, ribbed gourd, snake gourd, 
lab-lab, Chow-Chow, Coccinea, Bottle gourd and 
fruits like grapes, musk melon. These crops are 
being grown on commercial scale since they have 
tremendous market potential and are capable of 
giving high returns to the growers. The objective of 
the programme is to increase the productivity of 
gourd vegetables, enhance the quality of creeper 
vegetables, reduce the pest & disease incidence as 
the crop is better exposed, assist the small and 
marginal farmers to cultivate gourds etc through 
establishment of permanent pandals.
Permanent Pandal cultivation has the advantages 
like branches are well distributed and exposed to 
sunlight, convenience in carrying out cultural 
operations, easy to harvest fruits/vegetables, 
maximizing productivity with quality fruit 
production, results in higher yield as compared to 
open field cultivations, farmers don't have to invest 
in the supporting structure annually as it is 
permanent and benefits on the long run.
Intervention:
Considering the above-mentioned objectives, 
assistance has been provided for the establishment 
of Permanent Pandal system through Rashtriya 
Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY).  Assistance for 
cultivation of horticultural crops through 
establishment of permanent pandal system has 
Annual Report 2023-24
192
been provided for an area of 3209 Ha at an outlay of 
Rs.61.51 crore. Most of the farmers benefitted 
through this programme are small and marginal 
farmers. The beneficiary farmers have been 
provided back ended assistance @ Rs.2 lakh / ha for 
establishing permanent Pandal structure with 
stone pillar / concrete pillar with GI wire and for 
hybrid high yielding vegetable seeds. Each farmer 
is eligible for a maximum assistance of one-hectare 
area. The beneficiary farmers have also been 
encouraged to install drip irrigation from Pradhan 
Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana.
Outcome: 
Pandal is erected using Stone pillars and GI wires. 
Compared to conventional method, it is stable and 
durable. Hence, the farmer can cultivate for 
subsequent years using the same pandal structure. 
It is observed that percentage of yield increased 
considerably vis-à-vis the normal yield after 
introduction of Permanent Pandal.

Overview
17.1 
In accordance with the Government of India 
(Allocation of Business) Rules, Department of 
Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (DA&FW) is 
mandated to coordinate relief measures 
necessitated by drought, hailstorm, pest attack 
and
. Spatial distribution and 
 cold wave/frost
quantum of rainfall during South West Monsoon 
(June-September) mainly determines the incidence 
of drought in the country, as South West Monsoon 
(SWM) accounts for more than 70% of annual 
rainfall. DA&FW closely monitors progress of SWM 
in the country, in coordination with India 
Meteorological Department (IMD), Ministry of 
Earth Sciences, and keeps a watch over 
deficient/large deficient rainfall conditions.
17.2 
The State Governments initiate necessary 
relief measures in the wake of natural calamities 
from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), 
which is readily available with them. Contribution 
to SDRF is made by the Central and the State 
Governments in the ratio of 3:1 for 18 General 
Category States namely, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, 
Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, 
Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, 
Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, 
Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal and in the ratio of 
9:1 for 10 Special Category States  namely,  North 
Eastern States of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, 
Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim 
and Tripura and  hilly States of Himachal Pradesh 
and Uttarakhand. The Government of India 
supplements the efforts of the State Governments 
by providing requisite financial and logistic support 
in the wake of natural calamities. Additional 
financial assistance over and above SDRF is 
considered from the National Disaster Response 
Fund (NDRF) for natural calamities of severe 
nature, as per the established procedure and extant 
items and norms for assistance from SDRF/NDRF. 
Allocation under SDRF is made on the basis of 
recommendations of the Finance Commission and 
allocation under SDRF is for the State Governments 
only.
17.3 
On receipt of Memorandum from the State 
Government, an Inter-Ministerial Central Team 
(IMCT) is constituted. IMCT visits the State to assess 
the loss/damage to crops etc. and recommends 
appropriate financial assistance from NDRF. During 
2023-24, the State Governments of Karnataka, 
Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra have submitted 
Memorandums seeking financial assistance from 
NDRF for drought in the States during Kharif 2023. 
Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) have been 
constituted to visit the States for assessing 
loss/damage to crops etc. and recommend 
appropriate financial assistance from NDRF.
17.4 
DA&FW has reviewed and updated the 
Crisis Management Plan (CMP) for Drought during 
the current year i.e. 2023. The Plan defines the roles 
and responsibilities of various agencies involved in 
crisis management, including media management 
during drought. CMP, 2023 was circulated to all the 
States/Union Territories for preparation of State 
Crisis Management Plan.
17.5 
Central Research Institute for Dryland 
Agriculture (CRIDA), under Indian Council of 
Agricultural Research (ICAR), has developed 
detailed district-wise contingency plans to provide 
a broad advisory to farmers. These contingency 
plans prescribe alternate strategies in the event of 
climate variability by factoring in crops/ 
livestock/aquaculture practices/pattern, soil 
characteristics, infrastructural facilities, etc.  These 
plans have been developed based on certain 
simulated models for different weather conditions 
like occurrence of flood, drought, cyclone, cold 
wave/frost, etc. CRIDA has prepared Contingency 
Plans for 
 districts of the country.

17.6 
A unified geo-portal for monitoring and 
management of drought has been developed by the 
Department. The portal hosts all drought related 
indicators- weather, soil moisture, remote-based 
crop conditions, water storage etc., on a single 
digital platform for use by the States. It enables easy, 
timely and objective assessment of drought 
situation over any district or region.

19.1  Overview 
Agriculture Census is conducted in the country at 
five yearly intervals. It aims at collecting 
information related to structural characteristics 
of operational holdings in the country. Periodic 
Census is the main source of information on 
number, area and other basic characteristics of 
operational holdings such as land use, cropping 
pattern, irrigation, tenancy status, input use etc. 
So far, ten Agriculture Censuses have been 
conducted since 1970-71 and the current 
Agriculture Census with reference year 2021-22 is 
11  in the series.
th
The constituent activities of the Agriculture 
Census Programme are carried out in three 
distinct Phases which are statistically linked 
together. The Agriculture Census data is collected 
following a Census-cum-Sample Survey approach, 
after completion of the reference year. During 
Phase-I of the Census, data on primary 
characteristics of operational holdings, like 
number of holdings and area operated by different 
size class (marginal, small, semi-medium, 
medium and large), social groups (SC, ST, Others), 
gender (m ale/female), types of holding 
(individual, joint and institutional), etc. are 
collected. The second Phase of the Census collects 
data on detailed characteristics of operational 
holdings such as land use, irrigation status, 
cropping pattern etc.
Phase-III of Agriculture Census, (referred as Input 
Survey) is conducted as a follow up survey to the 
Agriculture Census (reference year as next 
Agriculture year to that of the Agriculture Census) 
to collect data on input use pattern of operational 
holdings in the country. Time series data generated 
through the Agriculture Census provides valuable 
information on structural changes that take place 
over time in agriculture sector. The results of 
Agriculture Census are published in the form of 
reports and are placed on the website of the 
Department (http://agcensus.nic.in) for public 
use.

 is 
Krishonnati Yojana
being implemented with an objective to restructure 
and strengthen the agricultural extension 
machinery with a judicious mix of extensive 
physical outreach of personnel, enhancement in 
quality through domain experts & regular capacity 
building, interactive methods of information 
dissemination, Public Private Partnership, 
pervasive & innovative use of Information & 
Communication Technology (ICT) / Mass Media, 
Federation of groups and convergence of extension 
related efforts under various Schemes and 
programmes of Government of India and the State 
Governments. The SMAE aims to appropriately 
strengthen, expand and upscale existing Extension 
Schemes. The ongoing Extension Schemes include 
the Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored 
Schemes being implemented by the Extension 
Division/Directorate of Extension. Even in the case 
of Central Sector Schemes which have been 
subsumed within the Mission, a greater role has 
been envisaged for the States through their active 
involvement in planning, implementation and 
monitoring.
20.2  Objectives and Achievement of Major 
Schemes
20.2.1 SUPPORT TO STATE EXTENSION 
PROGRAMMES FOR EXTENSION REFORMS 
SCHEME (ATMA SCHEME)
The Scheme 'Support to State Extension 
Programmes for Extension Reforms (ATMA)' 
implemented since 2005 has now been included as 
a Centrally Sponsored component of the Sub-
Mission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE) under 
Green Revolution – Krishonnati Yojana.  It is now 
under implementation in 739 districts of 28 States 
& 5 UTs of the country. The Scheme promotes 
decentralized farmer-driven and farmer 
accountable extension system through an 
institutional arrangement for technology 
dissemination in the form of an Agricultural 
Technology Management Agency (ATMA) at 
district level. Under the Scheme,  Grants-in-Aid is 
released to States with an objective to support State 
Governments efforts of revitalization of the 
extension system and making available the latest 
agricultural technologies in different thematic 
areas to increase agricultural production through 
extension activities viz. Farmers Training, 
Demonstrations, Exposure Visits, Kisan Mela, 
Mobilization of Farmers Groups and Setting up of 
Farm Schools. Through these activities, latest 
agriculture technologies are disseminated to 
farmers of the country. 
In order to promote key reforms under the Scheme, 
ATMA Cafeteria 2018 continues to support 
activities in line with the following policy 
parameters:
 
 
 At 

Multi-agency extension strategies:
least 10% of allocation on recurring 
activities at district level is to be used 
through non-governmental sector viz. 
NGOs, Farmers' Organization (Fos), 
Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), para-
extension workers, agri-preneurs, input 
suppliers, corporate sector, etc.
 
 
 The activities 

Farming system approach:
specified in the cafeteria are broad enough 
to promote extension delivery consistent 
with farming systems approach and 
extension needs emerging through

21.3 
Modifications in new policy on Seed 
 
Development:- The National Seed Policy, 2002 
provides that all imports of seeds and planting 
materials etc. promoted subject to EXIM Policy 
Annual Report 2023-24
222
Guidelines and the requirements of the Plants, 
Fruits and Seeds (Regulation of import into India) 
Order, 1989 and amendments thereon. The import 
of parental lines of newly developed varieties will 
also be encouraged. The policy also ensure that 
imported seeds and planting materials should meet 
the minimum seed standards of seed health, 
germination, genetic and physical purity as 
prescribed. All importers will make available a 
small sample of the imported seed to the Gene Bank 
maintained by the National Bureau of Plant Genetic 
Resources (NBPGR). In order to harmonize the New 
Policy on Seed Development, 1988 with the 
National Seed Policy, 2002, the following two 
modifications have been made in the new Policy on 
Seed Development, 1988:  
(I)
Seeds of wheat and paddy
  
 – In order to 
provide to the Indian farmer the best planting 
material available in the world to increase 
productivity, the import of seeds of wheat and 
paddy may also be allowed as per provisions of the 
Plant Quarantine Order, 2003 as amended from 
time to time for a period not exceeding two years by 
companies, which have technical/financial 
collaboration agreement for production of seeds 
with companies abroad, provided the foreign 
supplier agrees to supply parent line seeds/ 
nucleus or breeder seeds/ technology to the Indian 
company with in a period of two years from the date 
of import of the first commercial consignment after 
its import has been recommended by DAC. For trial 
and evaluation of the variety sought to be imported 
by eligible importers, 16 kg. seed in case of wheat 
and 5 kg. in case of paddy will be given to ICAR or 
farms accredited by ICAR for sowing. After receipt 
of satisfactory results of trial/evaluation, an 
eligible importer may apply for bulk import of such 
seeds to the Department of Agriculture and 
Farmers' Welfare. 
(ii)  
Similar procedure of trial/evaluation has 
been recommended for import of seeds of coarse 
cereals, pulses and oil seeds. Further, Seeds 
Division has simplified the forms for export and 
import of seeds and planting material. 
21.4 Implementation of OECD Seed schemes in 
 
India: The objective of the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
Seed Schemes is to encourage the use of seeds of 
consistently high quality in participating countries. 
The scheme authorizes the use of labels and 
certificates for seeds produced and processed for 
international trade according to OECD guidelines. 
The scheme also facilitates the import and export of 
seeds, by the removal of technical trade barriers 
through internationally recognized labels. India's 
participation in OECD schemes aims to enhance 
seed export capabilities and probabilities. The 
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare has 
become a member of the OECD Seed Scheme from 
23 October, 2008 and 263 varieties in more than 20 
crops have been offered for enlistment in OECD list 
of varieties since the inception of the scheme. A 
National Task Force on OECD Scheme has also been 
constituted to enhance India's share of seed export 
through this scheme.

Division, DA&FW is implementing Sub-Mission on 
Seeds & Planting Materials (SMSP) from the year 
2014-15 to promote production and multiplication 
of quality seeds of agricultural crops, so that the 
required quantities of seeds could be made 
available to farmers in the country. 
Under the Sub-Mission on Seeds and Planting 
Material (SMSP), the Seed Division is implementing 
the Seed Village Programme to upgrade the quality 
of farmer's saved seeds. Under this programme, 
financial assistance for distribution of 
foundation/certified seeds at 50% subsidy for 
cereal crops and 60% for pulses, oilseeds, fodder 
and green manure crops for production of quality 
seeds is available/ provided for farmers including 
women farmers. The objective of this scheme is to 
make available improved /high yielding varieties 
seeds to the farmers in time to achieve self-
sufficiency in respect of seeds at village level itself.
The scheme is demand driven and implemented by 
the concerned State for welfare of all farmers 
including that of women farmers. There is no 
separate budget allocated/ earmarked and 
released exclusively for woman farmers. However, 
implementing States/ agencies are requested to 
cover adequate participation of women farmers' in 
the scheme.

Palampur (Himachal Pradesh), Ranchi (Jharkhand) 
and Guwahati (Assam). 
3. Activities of the PPV&FR Authority:- 
The Authority provides a system for IP protection on 
the plant varieties to the plant breeders, the rights of 
farmers either as cultivators of the varieties or plant 
breeders and to encourage the development of new 
varieties of plants. Any variety that essentially fulfills 
the criteria of distinctiveness, uniformity and 
stability (DUS) and novelty (in the case of new 
variety) is eligible for registration under the 
provisions of PPV&FR Act, 2001.
4. DUS Test Centers 
DUS test centres are established in different 
agroclimatic zones in the country under the 
National Agricultural Research System (NARS). 
Each variety has to be evaluated for its being  
distinct at least in one of the many notified traits 
under the Guidelines of the species, over any 
existing variety anywhere in the world 
(Distinctiveness (D)), while remaining uniform 
through  genetic purity (uniformity (U)) and 
remain unchanged over two cycles of reproduction 
for stability (S)) over two seasons (years) after 
raising at least one generation through sexual 
propagation in case of seed based varieties or 
notified vegetative propagation means of the crop 
species which do not produce seeds. Morphological 
descriptor sets of characters as they vary crop-
species-wise is notified for the species in National 
Gazetteer of India with full guidelines published in 
Plant Variety Journal. So far, over the thirteen years 
of its existence, 172 crop species have been notified 
with guidelines printed on Plant Variety Journal as 
well as on website of the PPVFR. The total number 
of DUS Test Centre are around 150. 
5. Plant Variety Journal of India
As provided in the PPV&FR Act (2001), the 
Authority publishes its official journal “Plant 
Varieties Journal of India” (PVJI) as a monthly

Authority has established National Gene Bank to 
store the seed material including parental lines 
submitted by the breeders of the registered 
varieties. The seed lot is stored under low 
temperature conditions at 5  C for the entire 
0
registration period, and if necessary after few years 
of storage in the National Gene Bank, the seed lot 
will be rejuvenated and replenished at the cost of 
the applicant. The seed stored in the National Gene 
Bank will be used for dispute settlement or when an 
exigency arises for invoking compulsory licensing 
provision. Such a seed deposition in the National 
Gene Bank would dissuade market malpractices or 
violations as the sample in custody can be drawn to 
verify the facts. When the period of registration 
granted lapses, the material automatically moves to 
public domain.

Recognizing the role played by farmers in 
maintaining seed, selecting for variants in the 
traditional variety they have been cultivating in the 
past decades or sharing the seed with others the 
farmers of India play the role of growers of the 
variety as well as plant breeders by tradition,  the 
PPVFRA (2001) as a large departure from plant 
variety protection systems in other countries, 
enables a farmer in the same manner as a plant 
breeder to breed and register the variety keeping 
value of novelty, distinctiveness, uniformity and 
stability of the new variety.

India:
Working along the lines of IRRI's vision and mission, 
directions of the Government of India, our members, 
and the needs of the stakeholders, IRRI South Asia 
Regional Centre (ISARC) is dedicated to abolishing 
poverty and hunger among people, create 
sustainable rice-based agri-food systems that are in 
tandem with the changing climate, and  ensuring 
nutrition and food security for a burgeoning 
population without putting undue pressure on an 
already degrading environment. This is being done 
by ISARC through its three units: Centre of Excellence 
in Rice Value Addition (CERVA), Centre of Excellence 
in Sustainable Agriculture (CESA) and Centre of 
Education, Innovation and Research for 
Dev elo pm en t ( CE IR D)  by  e s tab lis hin g 
direct/indirect collaborations with system 
stakeholders, carrying out cutting-edge research, 
bridging the gap between lab to land findings, 
creating accessible platforms for learning, and 
knowledge dissemination, and through capacity 
development programs. The major achievements of 
ISARC in the year 2023 are as follows:
1. Centre of Excellence in Rice Value Addition 
(CERVA) 
With the focus on exploring the inherent diversity 
of landraces to bring out the premium quality rice 
and develop rice-based value-added products, key 
activities under CERVA are as follows:
1.1 
Identification of promising low GI 
 
Kalanamak accessions: 
 
o Three traditional Kalanamak accessions 
were shortlisted with superior aroma and 
cooking quality and optimal yield potential. 
Also, out of them, one low Glycemic Index 
(GI) Kalanamak accession has been 
identified utilizing the state-of-the-art 
phenotyping procedures. 
 
o Superior selected accessions have been 
included in the field evaluation trials being 
conducted in the Krishi Vigyan Kendras 
(KVKs) and farmer fields of targeted 
geographical indication areas, viz. 
Gorakhpur and Siddharthnagar and 
systematic grain quality evaluation for 
positioning them. Positioning the superior 
Kalanamak in the seed system will be 
undertaken.
1.2 
Development of ultra-low GI lines
 
: With 
the strong collaboration of ISARC with IRRI 
headquarters, ultra-low glycaemic index (GI) rice 
varieties have been developed. Being with GI value 
of <45 and high yielding, a first set was formally 
presented to Philippine President Ferdinand 
Marcos, Jr. at the opening ceremony of the 6  
th
International Rice Congress 2023. In this line, ultra-
low GI lines are in process of getting imported and 
the IRRI administration is planning to present high-
value ultra-low GI and low GI lines to the 
Government of India. 
1.3 
Exploring enriched rice quality lines 
 
from Northeast India: A total of around 100 highly 
diverse germplasms from the state of Assam and 
other neighboring regions of North-East India 
(through the APART-Assam project) were analysed. 
Preliminary assessments of grain quality revealed 
the extensive diversity among these indigenous 
varieties, along with ongoing evaluations of their 
nutritional attributes. A few high-quality 
accessions were shortlisted with high aroma, 
higher antioxidants, and with waxy nature. 
Through this initiative CERVA aims at identifying 
high-quality rice varieties tailored for distinct 
market segments. Comprehensive grain quality and 
nutritional profiling of these lines will be 
completed in the coming days.
1.4 
ISO accreditation
 
: CERVA has been able to 
successfully secure ISO 17025:2017 accreditation 
of its laboratory after several rounds of audit by the 
Annual Report 2023-24
232
National Accreditation Board for Testing and 
Calibration Laboratories (NABL). At present there 
are a total of 225 scopes covering quality and safety 
evaluation of four different agricultural 
commodities. As per the regulatory requirement, 
CERVA laboratory needs to undergo one more audit 
in the first half of 2024. Updation of the documents 
will be done before that and possibility to increase 
the scopes will also be evaluated. 
1.5 
Identification of bioactive- and fatty-acid 
 
enriched rice lines: CERVA has identified a few 
important landraces with significant nutritional 
quality. Rice lines with higher bioactive contents 
and higher concentration of essential fatty acids, 
such as alpha-linolenic acid or omega-3 fatty acid, 
have been identified through extensive analysis. 
Multiple field experiments are going on to confirm 
the superior nutritional quality of these lines. 
Analysis of the samples will be conducted from 
early 2024 onwards to confirm the results.
1.6 
Support to National Agriculture 
 
Research and Extension System (NARES) 
partners: 
 
ISARC offered the capacity development 
training program in Grain Quality Analysis 
organized at ISARC with the help of Centre of 
Education, Innovation and Research for 
Development (CEIRD). 
1.7 
Providing services to farmers producer 
 
organizations (FPOs) and government 
departments: Apart from the research work, CERVA 
has extended expertise and services on grain quality 
to external partners like the Agricultural and 
Processed Food Products Export Development 
Authority (APEDA), District Agriculture Offices 
(DAO) in Balrampur, Chandauli, local farmers, 
Farmers Producer Organizations (FPOs) and private 
enterprises. To bolster international collaboration 
and the Seed Without Border Initiative, CERVA has 
profiled several top rice varieties of Bangladesh, as 
per the Breeder Seed Indent of Bangladesh. Under 
South-South collaboration, CERVA has acquired 
germplasm from Burundi and Mozambique for grain 
quality analysis.
1.8 
Development of novel range of rice-
 
based products: CERVA has successfully created a 
range of commercially appealing, nutritionally 
enriched, and health-conscious food products. 
These offerings utilize a variety of traditional 
aromatic, pigmented, and non-pigmented rice 
varieties. The product line includes breakfast 
cereals, convenient meal options, as well as gluten-
free rice and millet bakery items.
o 
Whole grain gluten free rice flakes muesli - 
Whole grain rice flakes muesli is a nutritious 
and innovative option catering to the growing 
demand for gluten-free breakfast and snack 
choices. It features a unique blend of aromatic 
whole grain rice flakes, black popped rice, chia 
seeds, and nuts, providing a distinctive texture 
and a range of health benefits. By using whole 
grain rice flakes as its foundation, this muesli 
sets itself apart from typical options like wheat 
or corn flakes, offering a gluten-free alternative 
for those with dietary restrictions. It is a rich 
source of complex carbohydrates, ensuring 
sustained energy throughout the day. With chia 
seeds supplying fibre and omega-3 fatty acids, 
and nuts contributing healthy fats and protein, 
this muesli is both flavorful and nutritious. 
Emphasizing its nutritional advantages, gluten-
free status, and versatility could form the 
cornerstone of a robust marketing campaign.
o 
The Instant 
Instant rice semolina upma mix -
Rice Semolina Upma Mix is a pre-packaged 
blend tailored for a quick preparation of the 
beloved South Indian breakfast dish, upma. It 
combines rice semolina (rava) with a precise 
mix of spices and seasonings, eliminating the 
need for individual ingredient measurements. 
This is a game-changer for busy mornings or 
when time is tight, offering a hassle-free route 
to a satisfying meal. The pre-roasted semolina 
and seasoned blend drastically cuts down on 
cooking time—just add hot water and let it sit.

o 
Millets stand out as 
Rice-millet cookies - 
nutritional powerhouses compared to rice, 
offering higher levels of protein, dietary fiber, 
energy, and essential minerals. Despite their 
small size, they pack a punch with an abundance 
of vitamins and minerals. In particular, Small 
Millets boast impressive quantities of 
magnesium, calcium, manganese, phosphorus, 
iron, and valuable antioxidants. Recognized for 
their natural antioxidant properties, these 
millets are gaining recognition as a 
comprehensive nutrient source. Introducing 
these lesser-known millets into our food 
resources is crucial for achieving nutritional 
security, especially in the face of emerging 
climate challenges and health risks. CERVA is at 
the forefront of utilizing millets like finger millet, 
pearl millet, little millet, and foxtail millet in the 
development of both rice and millet-based 
cookies. This innovative approach not only 
expands dietary options but also harnesses the 
full potential of these nutrient-rich grains.
2. Centre of Excellence in Sustainable 
Agriculture (CESA)
ISARC nurtures core research conducted by IRRI 
and its partners in South Asia through its vertical 
CESA. It functions through six integrated sections, 
namely: Innovative Breeding, Robust Seed System, 
Geospatial Intelligence, Adaptive Agronomy, Pest 
Ecology, Mechanization and Postharvest, Natural 
Resource Management, Value Chain and 
Entrepreneurship Development. CESA's key 
activities include:
2.1 
Innovative Breeding: 
 
2.1.1 Enhancing NARES's breeding capability 
for the release of new varieties: 
 
 
A total of 25,414 seed packets were shared 
•
across 42 NARES partners during the Kharif 
2023. This includes 6,400 seed packets of 
early-duration lines of three distinct 
pipelines (DELS-I, DELS-R, TEMS-I), 5,328 
seed packets of medium duration line of 
three pipelines (TMeLS-I, TMeLS-R-d, and 
TMeLS-R-f) and 4,476 seed packets of late-
duration varieties. This distribution effort 
encompassed a total of 1,953 Stage-1 lines 
and 452 Stage-2 lines, contributing to a 
comprehensive initiative in support of 
NARES breeding efforts in developing new 
generation rice varieties. 
 
 
During Kharif 2023, a total of 40 promising 
 
•
lines were nominated (1  year of testing) to 
st
AICRP for testing and release. Also 14 and 7 
promising lines are in the 2nd and 3rd year 
of testing, respectively. 
 
 
In the year 2023, three new rice varieties 
•
were released. These include "Malviya 
Manila Sinchit Dhan 1" developed in 
collaboration with BHU, and "CR Dhan 
211
CR Dhan 212
" and " 
" developed in 
collaboration with ICAR-NRRI. 
2.1.2 Trait mapping and gene discovery 
(evaluation of 3K/AM panel):
 
• 
Genome-wide association analysis of 3K 
subset identified 32 MTAs for percent 
survival under submergence condition 
from three location phenotyping data 
(NRRI, AAU and BAU). Haplo-pheno 
analysis identified superior haplotype for 
Os03g49990 and Os11g25990 genes which 
contributes 65% to 78% of phenotypic 
variance/trait value. 
 
 
Superior haplotype (H68) of Os06g18000 
•
was identified for reproductive stage 
drought tolerance which contributed up to 
29.45% of phenotypic variance. 
 
 
The superior haplotype (H18) of a receptor-
•
like kinase gene, i.e., Os11g36160, was 
identified for brown planthopper (BPH), 
which contributes to strong resistance level 
(score of 1-3). 
 
 
Haplo-pheno analysis of candidate genes 
•
identified superior haplotypes, viz., 
Os12g29750 (H75- 6%) for grain yield, 
Os02g40130 (H77- 9.9%) for tiller number, 
and, Os07g29780 (H62- 18%) for panicle 
length. 
 
 
 Through GWAS analysis, a total of 20 and 10 
•
MTAs are identified for days to first 
emergence and early vigor traits under dry 
direct-seeded rice condition. 
Annual Report 2023-24
234
 
 
Deep emergence is an important trait of 
•
machine sown dry DSR for uniform crop 
es t ab li s h m en t . S e v en te e n  n ove l  
quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to deep 
emergence traits and genes with superior 
haplotypes for anaerobic germination in 
rice were identified. We are actively 
evaluating nine different mapping 
populations for targeted traits such as yield, 
grain quality, deep emergence, and drought 
resistance, with ongoing genotyping efforts. 
 
 
We conducted haplotype diversity analysis 
•
for a substantial set of 32,000 rice genes, 
which carried high or moderate single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects, in 
the 3k panel and an extended panel of 3,474 
rice genotypes (3K-RG + association 
mapping panel). This analysis allowed us to 
identify unique haplotypes associated with 
key traits, including yield, grain quality, DSR 
traits, and genes related to both biotic and 
abiotic stresses.  
2.1.3 Development of multiple stresses 
resistance/tolerance traits for transplanted 
puddled rice (TPR) and DSR condition: 
● 
More than 400 F  family developed for TPR 
6
conditions with multiple stress tolerance were 
evaluated in farmer fields for selection for yield 
and plant type, and for drought tolerance at the 
ISARC farm. These lines were developed in the 
background of DRR Dhan 42, DRR Dhan 44, DRR 
Dhan 50 Sarjoo 52, RP bio-226, etc. Also, a total of 
261 new lines in the F3 family (46 in CR Dhan 
801 and 215 in RP Bio 226) are being grown in 
Kharif 2023 for selection under TPR condition. 
● Eighteen F /  promising lines with multiple 
5
6
genes/QTLs for DSR adoptive traits and stress 
tolerance traits were evaluated for dry DSR and 
grain quality. Also, a total of 165 new sets of F3 
breeding lines (154 in Sarjoo-52, 5 in DRR Dhan 
48 and 6 in Swarna-Sub 1) are being grown in 
Kharif 2023 for selection under dry DSR 
condition.
● We have created user-friendly pipelines for 
data analysis and prediction, facilitating 
further advancements in crop breeding and 
resilience.
2.1.4 Breeding to develop biofortified rice and 
landrace improvement: 
● 
NILs carrying superior haplotypes of 
 
OsNAS3
gene were developed and five promising 
lines yielding equal to recipient parents 
(MTU1010, DRR Dhan 44) with high grain 
zinc were nominated to AICRP for testing and 
release. 
● 
A total of 16 dwarf Tulsi manjiri lines (BC F , F ); 
1
2
4
74 dwarf Jeera 32 lines (BC F , F ) and 16 dwarf 
1
3
4
Kalanamak lines (F ) were grown for selection 
3
and advancement. 
● 
A total of 15 dwarf mutant lines (M3/4) of Black 
rice and 2 dwarf mutant lines (M3/4) of 
Kalanamak rice were grown in Kharif 2023 for 
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
235
evaluation.   
2.1.5 Strengthening NARES through innovative 
breeding strategies such as speed breeding, 
haplotype-based breeding, AI based trait 
mapping, etc.:
● We have successfully optimized a speed breeding 
protocol to grow four to five generations of rice 
varieties (indica and japonica) in a year. The 
protocol worked for all three durations of rice 
(early, medium, and late). To make it more 
robust, we further tested an optimized protocol 
on 412 genotypes covering all 12 subgroups of 
Oryza sativa. In field conditions, the flowering 
time of these genotypes ranged from 58 to 127 
days. However, under speed breeding, 85% of 
genotypes flowered within a shorter period of 
80 days. Ten percent of varieties flowered 
between 80 to 100 days. 
● We have developed NILs for yield, drought, 
bacterial leaf blight, blast, and zinc in various 
genetic backgrounds like Naveen, Ranjeet, and 
DRR Dhan 44 and a few of the NILs 
outperformed recipient parents, signifying the 
success of this innovative approach. 
● Indian genome makeup project: A total of 370 
Indian germplasm (high quality landraces, high 
yielding varieties, breeding lines) have 
undergone whole-genome re-sequencing. 
Subsequent data analysis has revealed the 
presence of numerous distinctive haplotypes 
exclusively found in Indian genotypes. 
Additionally, investigations into domestication 
and Genome- Wide Association Studies (GWAS) 
 
have uncovered evidence of breeding bottlenecks 
and regions with heightened recombination rates 
within the association mapping panel.
2.1.6 Supporting NARES partners on speed 
breeding in paddy:
● We are actively supporting our NARES 
partners in their endeavours to implement 
speed breeding techniques in paddy 
cultivation. The support is being provided in 
two ways one as providing technical support 
in establishing their facility and second 
helping in advancing partners materials based 
on space availability. We are also going to start 
optimizing protocols for wild rice and their 
utilization in developing mapping and 
breeding populations 
2.1.7 Establishment of disease phenotyping and 
genome editing facility: 
● We are currently in the process of establishing a 
disease phenotyping and genome editing 
facility. The initial phase of collecting 
quotations has been successfully completed, 
we have now progressed to the procurement of 
necessary instruments and infrastructure 
development. 
2.1.8 Training and capacity building:
• 
Conducted a One-week training program on 
"Innovative Breeding for Crop Improve- ment” 
from Nov 22- 28, 2023 at ISARC.
• 
12 breeding staff attended the 6  International 
th
Rice Congress in Manila, Philippines and 6 staff 
attended Plant and Genomic Conference of 2023 
at Perth, Australia.
2.2 
Robust Seed System
 
2.2.1 Crop cafeterias for testing and screening 
 
of newly released varieties:
● In 2023, new crop varieties were tested and 
promoted through crop cafeterias in India and 
Bangladesh. 29 crop cafeterias were 
conducted in 2023, focusing on initial testing 
and awareness raising for different 
stakeholders such as KVKs, State Agricultural 
Universities (SAUs), farmers, and private 
agencies.
● In Bangladesh, six crop cafeterias were 
conducted during both Rabi and Kharif seasons 
across three distinct ecologies. These cafeterias 
served as platforms for initial testing and 
awareness among stakeholders.
● With technical collaboration of Nepal 
Agricultural Research Council (NARC) two such 
cafeterias were established, one each in the 
central and western region of Nepal.
2.2.2 On-Farm Trials (OFTs):
 
● During the Kharif season 2023, extensive OFTs 
were conducted in India and Bangladesh for

evaluating new rice genotypes in farmers' fields 
across multiple ecosystems. In India, 330 OFTs 
were carried out across seven states, focusing on 
five market segments: DMeLS-I, DELS-I, TEMS-I, 
TMeLS-I, and TLaSF-I/R. Simultaneously, in 
Bangladesh Seed System and Product 
Management (SSPM) unit conducted 120 OFTs 
spanning eight ecosystems across eight 
divisions. Additionally, in the Boro (Dry) season, 
150 OFTs were evaluated in five ecosystems 
across seven divisions. The number of new 
genotypes evaluated in India, Bangladesh and 
Nepal are 56, 44 and 7 respectively. IRRI 
established a total of 910 OFTs in these three 
countries including 209 targeted DSR OFTs. 
2.2.3
Cluster demonstrations:
  
● During the Kharif 2023, India, Bangladesh, and 
Nepal teams collectively conducted several 
clus ter de mons tration s to ge nerate 
awareness about, and community scaling of, 
best-evaluated varieties suited to different 
rice ecolog ies. In India, 44 cluster 
demonstrations for transplanted ecosystems 
covering 131 hectares and 19 demonstrations 
under the dry DSR system on 13.7 hectares 
were conducted. The varieties found scalable 
from OFTs from previous seasons, such as 
BINA Dhan 11, MTU 1156, DRR Dhan 44, 
Rajendra Saraswati, Swarna Samriddhi, CO 51, 
Uttar Sona, PR 126, PR 131, Sabour Harshit, 
Telangana Sona, and Sabour Heera were 
p op u la r i ze d  th r ou g h far m e r  fi el d  
demonstrations.

federations in the Kharif and Rabi seasons. 
Collaborations with BRRI resulted in breeder 
seed production of BRRI dhan88 and BRRI 
dhan92 for the upcoming Boro season, while 
partnerships with BINA led to the production of 
breeder seed for BINA Dhan 17, BINA Dhan 20, 
BINA Dhan 22, and BINA Dhan 26, available for 
private companies next year. IRRI-trained 
women-led groups multiplied and diffused 
these varieties.
2.2.6 Partnership for product management:
· 
IRRI has significantly strengthened the 
collaboration with national partners for 
product evaluation and scaling. The stronger 
partnerships with ICAR-institutes, BRRI, BINA, 
NARC have been instrumental in product listing 
for testing and diffusion. The intensive 
engagement with state seed corporations in 
India and BADC in Bangladesh facilitated seed 
chain advancement of several target varieties.
2.2.7 Seed Scaling:
 
· 
Climate-resilient and high yielding 
varieties- Rigorous testing and quality seed 
production were conducted for STRVs like 
BINA Dhan 11 (Submergence), BINA Dhan 17 
(Drought), Sabour Harshit (Drought), and 
Swarna Samriddhi Dhan (Multi-Stress). 
Awareness generation efforts were conducted 
for DRR Dhan 50 (Multi-Stress), IR64-Sub1 
(Submergence), and Samba Mahsuri-Sub1 
(Submergence). Varieties suitable for the DSR 
system have been widely demonstrated across 
rice ecosystems for awareness generation, 
testing and market positioning in Nepal and 
India. PR 126, BRRI Dhan 75 are among the 
potential DSR varieties. 
· 
Healthier rice- Three biofortified rice 
varieties, namely BRRI Dhan 84 (zinc- and iron-
rich with high antioxidants) and BRRI Dhan 
100 (zinc-rich), are being scaled up in Uttar 
Pradesh (UP). BRRI Dhan 69 a low GI variety is 
now highly popular in western Odisha. 
Additionally, seed production and scaling of 
Kalanamak accessions, namely Bauna 
Kalanamak 102, Kalanamak KN3, Kalanamak 
Kiran, and Kalanamak SL03 are underway in 
Gorakhpur, UP.
· 
Collaboration for seed increase- Stakeholder 
engagement was significantly enhanced through 
collaborations with four Krishi Vigyan Kendras 
(KVKs), agriculture departments, five private 
seed agencies, 25 Farmers collectives, and 
women's groups. Strategic partnerships were 
established with UP Beej Nigam, Odisha State 
Seed Corporations, and Assam Seed Corporations 
to ensure a steady introduction of new rice 
varieties, indicating a comprehensive and 
coordinated effort in advancing suitable varieties 
in the region.
2.2.8 Training and capacity development:
 
● SSPM units in India, Bangladesh, and Nepal 
collectively reached out and trained 1500 
farmers (35% women) on quality seed 
production, seed entrepreneurship and 
varietal intelligence, DSR-fit genotypes for 
ecology suitability and market demanded 
varieties. A total of 39 such trainings were 
conducted in association with NARES partners.
2.2.9 Seeds Without Borders (SWB):
 
● Under Seeds Without Borders program two 
biofortified rice varieties from Bangladesh 
namely, BRRI Dhan 84 and BRRI Dhan 100, 
along with one low input responsive green 
super rice viz. BRRI Dhan 99 were released in 
India by IIRR Hyderabad and are currently 
under a multiplication program for seed 
increase. 
● IRRI is facilitating two potential Indian varieties 
(Swarna Samriddhi and DRR Dhan 60) for 
release in Bangladesh under SWB.
2.2.10 Women-centred intervention approach:
 
· 
All interventions under SSPM have been 
gender-inclusive by ensuring appropriate 
representation and active participation of 
women. As a programmatic approach and 
mandate, 35% of all participants were women. 
The active engagement with women was in 
capacity building exercises for quality seed 
pro ductio n, on -fa rm  tri als , clus ter 
demonstrations, farmer to farm technology 
transfer in India and Bangladesh. The 300 tons 
Annual Report 2023-24
238
of seeds to be produced by the end of this 
season by women is a testament to the gender 
inclusive program approach. 88 individual 
women farmers from resource-poor areas of 
Palamu, Garhwa, Mahasamund Jangaon, 
Chandauli, Varanasi, Bargarh and Ganjam 
districts of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, 
Uttar Pradesh, and Odisha respectively were 
engaged in direct technology transfer through 
OFTs. Additionally, 26 women farmers belonging 
to women SHGs from Jansa, UP working with 
Transforming Rural India Foundation (TRIF) 
were engaged in technology transfer programs 
like Minikit trials and on-farm workshops on the 
DSR Package of practices.
2.2.11 Achievements:
  
● In India and Bangladesh, IRRI has profiled 110 
most demanded varieties. These profiles 
include all the trait information to aid 
stakeholders' decisions on adoption and 
replacement.
● 
Based on the on-field performance in different 
ecologies and market segments, 30 varieties 
have been scaled in India and Bangladesh 
through seed production by public, private, and 
farmers' organizations. 
● Production of about 300 tons of seeds of IRRI-
advanced varieties are expected by the end of 
this wet season. The seed chain infusion of 
these varieties through multiple channels will 
pave the way for larger diffusion of target 
varieties.
● Following the capacity building on production 
and EGS linkages, 25 farmers collectives (India 
and Bangladesh) have produced about 75 tons 
of seeds of best-evaluated varieties. 
● 
Significant collaborations with state seed 
corporations (UP, Odisha and Assam), private 
agencies and farmers networks have been 
established for amplification of best-ranked 
varieties in target states.
● The five SWB varieties (3 in India, 2 in 
Bangladesh) are now being multiplied for 
large-scale adoption and production. Five tons 
of breeder seed are in the multiplication plan 
and will be shared with NARES partners and 
other multiplying agencies for seed 
amplification.
● 
Seed scaling for four Kalanamak varieties 
started with seed growers in Kushinagar and 
Siddharthnagar in UP. About three tons of seeds 
will be produced by grower-farmers (mostly 
women) to meet local seed needs.
2.3 Geospatial Intelligence 
2.3.1 DSR mapping:

2.3.4 Standing Panel on Impact Assessment 
(SPIA) in Bangladesh:
● Quantified the impact of flood-tolerant rice 
varieties on post-flood crop survival and yield 
in three study districts. Rice area maps were 
developed for Aman season.
● 
Maps were generated on flood indicators – 
Flooded and non-flooded, flooding intensity, 
start of season, peak of season EVI (max) and 
crop season EVI slope accomplished.
● Measured the relative change in Vegetation 
Indices (VIs) that occur during flooding, before 
and after the introduction of stress-tolerant 
rice varieties (STRVs).
2.3.5 Precision agriculture:
 
● Tes tin g an d stan dardizing im agin g/ 
agricultural drone for precision crop 
management at the farmer's field level are 
being initiated.

Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for 
drone-based precision agriculture are 
currently being developed at the ISARC farm 
and at the BISA farm, Samastipur, under a 
project for the Climate-Smart Initiative funds of 
Government of Bihar.
● Using high resolution satellite images, 
processed and unprocessed market locations 
and spatial nutrient availability were 
developed for Nalanda district of Bihar.
● 
Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data and 
Landsat 8 satellite data were used to complete 
the mapping of rice and rice-fallow areas in 
West Benga l, Bihar, Jha rkhand , and 
Chhattisgarh, as well as their soil moisture 
suitability, with the goal of targeting the 
necessary interventions for increasing 
cropping intensity and diversification.          
Landsat and MODIS rice areas, and EVI 
phenology indicators, were extracted and 
Flood inundation maps for Aman rice for 
Bangladesh were generated for the period 
of 2001-2021 which provides intelligence 
to target or disseminate the flood-tolerant 
rice varieties in flood prone areas.
 
● Spatial and temporal variability of crop 
stress were mapped between June August 
–
2022 in seven states of India.
2.3.6 Mapping of abiotic and biotic stresses:
 
 
● Historical and current occurrence of abiotic 
stresses such as floods, droughts, and 
salinity were mapped for Odisha and 
Assam. Five years (2015-2021) flood and 
drought (Kharif and Rabi) maps were 
generated. Additionally, salinity maps were 
also generated for 2020-21. 
 
● Biotic stress risks and hotspots were 
mapped for rice growing ecosystems for 30

Adaptive Agronomy, Pest Ecology, 
 
Mechanization & Post-Harvest 
• 
Under the Direct Seeded Rice Consortium 
(DSRC), ISARC has been evaluating different 
cultivars including HT rice varieties, new 
herbicide molecules including drone-based 
spraying of herbicides, drone based direct 
seeding, and risks reducing agronomic practices 
in 14 states. In general, rice hybrids perform 
better than inbreds under DSR with yield gain of 
0.6 t/ha. Seed priming improved germination 
and yield under DSR with yield gain of 10-15%. 
Vattar-DSR reduces the risk of early weed 
competition while saving irrigation water and 
enabling immediate and early sowing of rice. 
• 
The collaborative experiment conducted at 
IARI showed that dry-DSR saved irrigation 
water by 20-25%, and reduced methane 
emissions by 72% compared to transplanted 
rice.  Mechanized or precision DSR has been 
promoted in 5,060 acres in Kharif 2023 in 
Odisha. The random crop cut from the previous 
year showed that yield gain was more than 1 
t/ha under drill-DSR than beushening systems. 
• 
Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) methods 
of irrigation have been promoted in the farmers 
field under irrigated ecosystems in Assam 
which saves irrigation water up to 38% without 
compromising yields.
• 
On-station experiments are ongoing at ISARC to 
measure water productivity and soil health 
under DSR and transplanted rice, water and 
nitrogen management in zero-till DSR; Zn-
enriched variety and Zn fertilizer effect on grain 
Zn content in rice; nano-urea and nano-DAP on 
rice and wheat yields and profit and different 
crop establishment methods and suitable 
varieties for DSR.  Additionally, the 
standardization of standard operating 
procedures (SoP) for drone-based foliar 
nutrition was a key area of emphasis.
• 
The experiment on nano-urea in wheat showed 
that 66% of recommended dose of nitrogen 
(RDN) with one foliar spray of nano-urea 4 
ml/L of water at 21 days after emergence 
produced a similar yield as that of 
recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN) 
indicating the possible reduction of 34% N 
without any yield penalty.  
• 
ISARC has been equipped with advanced dry-
chemistry based soil analysis: mid-infrared 
(MIR) spectroscopy. ISARC is in process of 
developing partnership with ICAR-IISS, 
Annual Report 2023-24

Platform in 2023 in addition to Jeevika. Agro 
advisories were sent to around 36,800 farmers 
(22% women) in Eastern UP and 719,624 
farmers (21% women) in Bihar.
• 
Gender Inclusive technology development, 
dissemination, and evidence generation- Cereal 
Systems Initiative for South Asia (CSISA) has 
nurtured a strong partnership with women-
targeted developmental programs such as 
JEEViKA in Bihar for on-field activities and 
robust evidence generation and convergence 
platform for inclusive extension system and 
now expanding the learning to Department of 
Mission Shakti (DMS)in Odisha, and PRERNA in 
UP through convergence platform in 2023. 22% 
and 27% women participated in different 
training, and capacity-building programs 
organized in Bihar and Odisha respectively. 
13% of demonstrations were led by women 
farmers. Women master trainers have been 
developed with DMS Odisha and Jeevika Bihar 
on mechanized DSR, Zero till and early wheat 
sowing. 
• 
Gender Equality and Social Inclusive (GESI) 
modules introduced and made mandatory in 
the ongoing landscape crop assessment survey 
(LCAS) Surveys including the segments on 
Production, Income, Time Management, 
Financial Services and Credits, Group 
Affiliations/Membership, and Extension 
Access to fill the gender data gap and generate 
robust evidence generation around gender. 
Introduced in the Landscape Diagnostic Survey 
(LDS) Pulse survey in 8 districts of UP and 6 
districts of Haryana in March 2023, to date 
5600 data points have been generated.
• 
To develop and improve the rice pests and 
diseases diagnostic and management solutions 
for the community of rice farmers in UP, a 
successful collaboration has been made with 
the Plantix Digital Agriculture Team (Germany) 
at ISARC, Varanasi.
• 
In Bangladesh, many experiments were laid out 
to evaluate crop diversification, nano-urea, 
varieties suitable for DSR conditions, 
optimizing planting dates, and integrated 
nutrient management in rice production 
systems.
• 
A mechanization hub on mechanized seed-to-
seed solutions for rice and succeeding crops 
(pulses, wheat, maize, and oilseeds), 
transplanting of paddy, and in-situ and ex-situ 
straw management has been established at 
ISARC. It has also been supporting CEIRD in 
strengthening the capacity of the stakeholders.
• 
The effectiveness of different direct seed 
planters in combination with the use of laser 
land leveller (LLL) for direct seeding and their 
impact on the Global Warming Potential (GWP) 
is being tested. The experiment involves LLL, 
planting seeds in wet terrain using a precision 
planter, drum seeder, and multi-crop planter. 
The study aims to assess several factors, such as 
cost economics, greenhouse gas emissions, and 
percentage changes in yield.
• 
Hermetic storage like super bag and cocoon 
were introduced in collaboration with BHU 
(KVK, Barkachha) for efficient seed storage for 
different crops. Reduction of paddy loss 
through utilization of combine harvesters, 
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
243
dryers and rice crop residue management 
including byproducts development are areas of 
future activities.
• 
ISARC has introduced compost turner as an 
innovative farm implement, developed by IRRI 
in collaboration with Nong Lam University 
(NLU), Vietnam. It converts paddy straw into 
biocompost within 45 days, whereas the 
conventional method takes 120 days. It 
optimizes decomposition efficiency and 
organic fertilizer quality by integrating physical 
and bio-chemical processes, specifically 
tailored for the eastern Indo Gangetic Plains. To 
demonstrate the potentiality of the compost 
turner, a 3-day hands-on training was 
organized at ISARC during 15-17 December 
2022. An experiment on the preparation of rice 
straw-based compost was conducted at ISARC, 
Varanasi during the Rabi season 2022-23. As 
evidenced from the results, mechanical 
compost turner can efficiently convert the 
paddy straw (1000 kg) and cow dung (1620 kg) 
to valuable compost (C/N: 11.06, N: 0.81%, K: 
0.8 %, EC: 6.24 dSm/m and pH: 8.13). 
2.5Natural Resource Management (NRM)

The project is in collaboration with IRRI-ISARC, 
BCI and H&M. 
• 
Conducted field events and awareness 
programs, extension programs, awareness 
demonstrations and hands-on training on 
farmer fields, and on-station at ISARC, Varanasi 
to enhance farmers' capacity development for 
improved nutrient management and soil health 
assessment.
Key highlights:
• 
Soil metagenomics study of organic and 
inorganic rice fields was performed and 
organically amended soil showed remarkably 
increased bacterial and fungal communities as 
compared to inorganic rice field soil samples. 
The study revealed better soil health under 
organic farming practices compared to 
chemical-based farming. 
• 
There were noticeable crop differences in 
natural and organic systems, namely, Mustard 
was found to be highly susceptible to aphid 
attack under natural farming systems, Mentha 
was found highly suitable for organic systems, 
and Indigenous rice varieties like Kalanamak 
and Kalamegha and basmati responded better 
than hybrids under organic systems.

244
• 
Expected outcomes under regenerative and 
natural farming practices: Enhanced nutrient 
use efficiency by 10-15 %, increased soil 
organic carbon (SOC) stock by 0.3-0.5 %, 
increased WUE by 10-15%, increased soil 
health in terms of soil microbes and related 
ecosystem and enhance adoption of new 
models for improving natural resources and 
habitat.
• 
More than 1,000 soil samples were analysed in 
2023 for various qualitative research programs 
and soil health assessments. 
• 
More than 10,000 farmers of eastern UP and 
6,000 extension staff including DoA, NGOs, 
private partners and rural youth became aware 
of digital agriculture and smart farming 
technology and more than 6,000 fertilizer 
advisories were received.
• 
More than 2000 small landholder farmers 
(~1200 male and 800 female) from different 
districts of UP were trained in 2023.
• 
Documented the nutrient content and basic 
properties of more than 10 low-cost bio-inputs 
and the easy farming strategy was standardized 
for rice-based cropping systems using a 
standard protocol.
• 
Organized an event “SAARC Regional Training 
on Climate Smart Agriculture in South Asia: 
Technologies, Policies and Digital Innovation” 
on 25 to 28 July 2023 at ISARC Varanasi with 
different SAARC countries participants.
2.6 Value Chain and Entrepreneurship 
Development (VED) 
• 
Investigated food supply chains for supplying 
healthy foods, and factors in the food 
environment that influence access to and 
purchase of nutritious food for poor consumers 
in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. The major 
drivers of high carbohydrate-based diets were 
found to be lower income, culturally driven 
dietary preferences, challenges in market 
accessibility, and large family size. Both female 
and male shoppers had similar perceptions 
about the safety, acquisition, affordability, and 
enjoyment of healthy and unhealthy food items. 
Unhealthy ultra-processed foods were found to 
have better availability and affordability 
compared to less processed healthy food in 
rural South Asia. 
• 
Implemented a behavioural experiment for 
crop and variety choice diversification in 
Odisha to understand the drivers and barriers 
(including social and gender) of adoption of 
improved varieties, crop diversification, and 
mechanized DSR. Preliminary results indicate 
that most of the farmers adopted seed trial 
packs of green gram and groundnut varieties 
and mechanized line sowing. Variety 
replacement is found to be very low and 
requires genotyping exploration. Farmers are 
more interested in cultivating vegetables in 
winter as it can fulfil their dietary demands and 
reduce consumption expenditure. The private 
seed delivery system has a competitive 
environment that ensures a better seed 
promotion and delivery system. 
• 
Investigating the adoption and effects of DSR on 
yield, income, labor displacement, livelihoods, 
and well-being, and women's role in 
adoption/disadoption in Odisha and Punjab. 
The success stories on advantages of 
mechanized Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) and 
mechanized seeding of non-rice crops (green 
gram, oilseeds, etc.) were documented in 
Odisha. District- and state-level workshops on 
the 'Policy Dialogue on Agricultural 
Mechanization in Odisha' were organized, and 
policy recommendations on agricultural farm 
mechanization were shared.
• 
Investigated reasons for rice fallow and 
adoption of stress-tolerant rice varieties 
(STRVs), mechanical transplanting (MTR) and 
direct sowing (DSR). The project interventions 
generated high demand for machinery and 
improved the local quality and seed availability

22.1  Overview 
Agricultural Mechanization is one of the key driver 
for sustainable development of agriculture sector. 
Mechanization helps in increasing production, 
productivity & house hold income by better & 
efficient management of the inputs like seeds, 
fertilizers, water, labour etc. It also helps to enhance 
the productivity of inputs, reduce losses, reduce 
operational time and drudgery associated various 
farm operations. Agricultural mechanization also 
helps in value addition and improving the quality 
farm produce for better market price.
Mechanization has been well received in India. In 
those States where agricultural mechanization has 
made good progress, its benefits are being shared 
by all farmers irrespective of the size of their 
operational holdings. However, the farm 
mechanization in India, notwithstanding inherent 
advantage, could able to achieve a meager growth 
rate in last few decades. Degree of farm 
mechanization is expressed as a ratio of mechanical 
power to cultivable unit area which stands at about 
2.49 kW/ha (2018-19). However, still there is 
disparity in its spread in various parts of the 
country and it is also compared lower to developed 
countries. For achieving optimum farm 
productivity, the farm power availability needs to 
be increased to at least 4kW/ha by 2030.
22.2 Government Initiatives
Sub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization 
(SMAM): Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers 
Welfare is already promoting agricultural 
mechanization through various schemes and 
programmes. However, in order to lay a special 
emphasis on farm mechanization and to bring more 
inclusiveness, a dedicated scheme 'Sub-Mission on 
Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM)' has been 
started from2014-15. SMAM is now being 
implemented under the umbrella of  Centrally 
Sponsored Scheme of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana 
(RKVY) and it has been decided that all the 
mechanization components under various 
schemes will now be implemented under SMAM.
Increasing the reach of farm mechanization 
to small and marginal farmers and to the 
regions where availability of farm power is 
low;
Promoting 'Custom Hiring Centers' to offset 
the adverse economies of scale arising due 
to small landholding and high cost of 
individual ownership;
Creating hubs for hi-tech & high value farm 
equipments;
Creating awareness among stakeholders 
through demonstration and capacity 
building activities;
Ensuring performance testing and 
certification at designated testing centers 
located all over the country.

22.6        State Agro Industries Corporations: The 
Government of India had advised the State 
Governments in the year 1964, to set up State Agro 
Industries Corporations (SAICs) in the public 
sector to act as catalysts in providing access to 
industrial inputs to farmers, for their use in 
agriculture. Thus, 17 SAICs were set up in the joint 
sector with equity participation of the Government 
of India and the respective State Governments of 
Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, 
Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, 
Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, 
Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and 
West Bengal during 1965 to 1970. Many of the State 
Governments have increased their equity 
participation as a result of which the Government of 
India, at present, is a minority shareholder. SAICs 
have since expanded their basic functions by 
commencing manufacture and marketing of 
agricultural inputs, implements, machines, after-
sales service, promotion and development of agro-
based units/industries. The Government of India is 
implementing a policy of disinvestment of its 
shares in SAICs with a view to give greater decision 
making power to the State governments by 
allowing transfer of its shares to state 
Governments. At present only 10 SAICS are in 
function which has Government of India equity.

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Division: 
IPM is an eco- friendly approach, which aims at 
keeping pests below economic threshold level by 
employing all available alternate pest control 
methods and techniques such as cultural, 
mechanical and biological with greater emphasis 
on use of bio-pesticides. The use of chemical 
pesticides is advised as a last resort when pests 
cross the economic threshold level (ETL). The 
Central Government has established 36 Central 
Integrated Pest Management Centres (CIPMCs) of 
the Directorate of Plant Protection, Quarantine & 
Storage (DPPQ&S) in 28 States and 2 UTs. The 
mandate of these Centres is to monitor insects, 
pests and diseases for forewarning, conservation of 
natural enemies in farmers' fields, production and 
field release of bio-control agents, promotion of 
eco-friendly IPM inputs like bio-pesticides/ plant 
base d pes tic ides a nd Hum an Res ourc e 
Development in IPM by imparting training to 
extension officers and farmers through Farmers 
Field Schools (FFSs) and IPM programs.
IPM activities are propagated through Farmers 
Field Schools (FFSs). This is a form of “learning by 
doing” concept evolved from the concept that 
farmers learn optimally from field observations 
and experimentation. FFSs are organized to 
empower farmers to take appropriate crop 
protection measures on their own. These FFSs are 
conducted both in Kharif and Rabi seasons and 
each FFS lasts for 14 weeks. 
During 2023-24 (Kharif season) a total number of 
103 Nos of Farmer Field Schools and 49 Nos of two 
days Human Resources Development programs 
were successfully conducted in which 3605 No's of 
farmers were trained and  2731 No's of farmers, 
pesticide dealers and State extension officials were 
trained about Integrated Pest Management 
techniques. 05 nos of five days programmes and 01 
number of season long training programme on 
Cotton crop was also conducted during Kharif 
2023-24 in which 200 nos of AEOs, Pesticide 
de ale rs , NG Os , Le ad  Fa rm er s, P riva te 
Entrepreneurs and 40 nos of master trainers were 
trained in these programmes respectively.  103 No. 
of FFS, 49 No. of 2 Day HRD & 05 No. of 5 Day HRD 
Programmes and 1 Number of Season Long 
Training Programme (SLTP) for Mango crop are 
allotted to 36 CIPMCs and 8 Locust-cum-IPM 
centers for the Season Rabi 2023-24, out of which 
Annual Report 2023-24
274
91 FFSs are ongoing and remaining programmes 
will be conducted before 15  March 2024.
th
Apart from conducting FFS, the CIPMCs carry out 
pest/disease monitoring, production, release and 
conservation of bio-control agents. During 2023-24 
(up to 15.01.2024), the pest and disease situation 
was surveyed covering 857.623 thousand hectares 
area. A total of 2799.013 million bio-control agents 
were mass produced in laboratories and released 
against targeted insect-pests in various crops. 
Augmentation and conservation was taken up in 
775.392 thousand hectares.
Fall Army Worm (FAW) is a trans-migratory pest 
affecting Asia & Pacific region. India is lead country 
among the South-East Asian region to promote 
sustainable FAW management / Control measures 
under FAO- Global initiative for FAW management. 
Regular surveys, surveillance and monitoring were 
conducted by the Central Integrated Pest 
Management Centres (CIPMCs) in collaboration 
with State Departments of Agriculture, SAUs and 
ICAR etc. Awareness cum training programmes was 
conducted on management of FAW in different 
States. Due to continuous efforts of DPPQ&S the 
area of Maize affected by FAW was decreased 
significantly. 
During 2023-24, IPM Division issued 09 Nos. of 
advisories/forewarnings on various pest/disease 
up to 15.01.2024. 
“Healthy seed-Healthy produce”- Seed treatment 
and Grow Safe Food (GSF) programmes were also 
taken up under IPM FFSs programmes. Seed 
treatment is the application of chemical and 
biological agents on seeds to control primary soil 
and seed borne infestation of insects and diseases, 
which are serious threats to crop production. Since 
2006, a seed treatment campaign is taken up every 
year by Department of Agriculture Co-operation 
and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) during Kharif and 
Rabi seasons involving State Departments of 
Agriculture and CIPMCs. Till date (Kharif and Rabi 
upto 15.01.2024) 307 nos of Seed Treatment 
campaigns and 230 nos of safe & judicious use of 
pesticides awareness programmes were conducted 
by IPM Division in which 7461 and 6083 nos of 
farmers participated respectively.  
Participation of Women Farmers in IPM activities:- 
6208 num bers of women farmers were 
participated in FFS, 2 Day HRD training 
programmes, Seeds treatment campaigns and safe 
and judicious use of pesticides programmes 
conducted by 36 CIPMC's during 2023-24 (till 
15.01.2024).
Central Insecticide Board & Registration 
Committee (CIB & RC)
The Secretariat of CIB & RC is entrusted with the 
processing of applications for grant of registration

Techno-Legal Cell: 
The provisions of the Act and Rules are executed by 
the State Agriculture Authorities. The licence to 
manufacture, sale, stock, exhibition for sale or 
distribution of any insecticides is issued by the 
licensing officer appointed by the State 
Governments after payment of the prescribed 
licence fee. Licenses are granted only after 
satisfying the availability of necessary plant and 
machinery, safety devices, first aid-facility, 
equipped with proper storage accommodation for 
avoiding any hazards etc in the premises where the 
insecticides is proposed to be manufactured or sale 
or distribution.
As per the Insecticide Act, 1968, the quality control 
of pesticides is primarily a responsibility of the 
States. Insecticide Inspectors appointed by the 
Central or State Governments (section 20) have 
been vested with powers to search premises, seize 
documents, stop distribution or sale of insecticides 
and take insecticide samples for analysis (section 
21). Such analyses are carried out by Insecticide 
Analysts appointed by Central or State 
Governments (section 19).  Dispute over analytical 
test reports are resolved through confirmatory 
tests in the Central Insecticides Laboratory (CIL) 
which has been established under section 16 of the 
Act.
At present, 11080 officers of various State 
Governments are notified as Insecticide Inspectors 
to check the quality of pesticides. To ensure 
availability of quality pesticides, 70
pesticide 
 State 
testing laboratories (SPTL) are established in 25 
States and 2 Union Territories with a total annual 
capacity to test 77,675 samples. 
The Central Government supplements the 
resources of State/UT Governments in quality 
control testing of pesticides. At present, 191 
Central Government officers are notified as Central 
Insecticide Inspector and there exists one Central 
Insecticide Laboratory at Faridabad and two 
Regional Pesticides Testing Laboratories at 
Chandigarh and Kanpur under the Directorate of 
Plant Protection, Quarantine & Storage (DPPQ&S) 
with an annual testing capacity of 4,700 samples.
Offences related to import, manufacture or sale of 
'misbranded' insecticides, which include use of 
deceptive or faulty labels, use of improper 
packaging, higher toxicity or counterfeiting of the

Locust Control and Research:
Locust is a trans-boundary migratory pest. It has the 
ability to fly hundreds of kilometers collectively in 
swarms. Found in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, 
they can inhabit some sixty countries and can cover 
one-fifth of Earth's land surface. Desert locust 
plagues can threaten the economic livelihood by 
destroying crops. Swarms of locusts come to India 
from spring breeding areas of Africa, Middle East and 
South West Asia during the monsoon season for 
summer breeding in Scheduled Desert Area of 
Rajasthan and Gujarat.  The scheme Locust Control 
and Research is being implemented through an 
Organization known as Locust Warning 
Organization (LWO) established during 1939 and 
later merged with the Directorate of PPQ&S in 1946. 
The Locust Warning Organization (LWO) monitors 
locust development and its activities over an area of 
2.05 lakh sq km of the Scheduled Desert Area (SDA) 
mainly in the states of Rajasthan and Gujarat and 
partly in Haryana. The Scheme is being executed 
through 10 Locust Circle Offices (LCOs) located at 
Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jalore, Phalodi, Nagaur, 
Suratgarh, Churu in Rajasthan and Palanpur & Bhuj 
in Gujarat, Locust Warning Organization (LWO) Field 
Headquarters at Jodhpur and Locust Division at 
Central Headquarter Faridabad (Haryana). Besides, 
there is one Field Station for Investigation on Locust 
(FSIL) situated at Bikaner. 
To strengthen locust monitoring and forecasting 
and as per the recommendations made during the 
28  Session of the FAO Commission in 2014 for 
th
Controlling the Desert Locust in South-West Asia 
(SWAC), an advanced device named eLocust3 and 
software RAMSES V4 has been made functional in 
LWO from January, 2016 with the cooperation of 
FAO. LWO has a wireless network for exchanging 
information on locust survey and control between 
various field offices and Hqrs. Faridabad. 
Satisfactory locust control potential is being 
maintained in the form of pesticides, plant 
protection equipment, wireless sets, GPS, eLocust3, 
eLocust3mpro and trained manpower. 
Regularly survey is being carried out in the 
scheduled desert area to monitor the presence of 
locust, ecological conditions and also to determine 
whether locust population has crossed the economic 
threshold level [adults more than 10,000 per km. and 
5-6 hoppers per bush] that may require control. 
Participation in the Indo-Pak Border monthly 
meetings (June to November) for exchange of locust     
situation information between two Countries for 
effectively monitoring the situation ensuring 
preparedness to tackle the emerging locust threat, 
if any.
Issuance of Desert Locust Situation Bulletin at 
fortnightly intervals to inform all the concerned 
stakeholders about the prevailing locust situation 
in India.
To maintain desert locust culture for conducting 
research on bio-efficacy of pesticides and bio-
pesticides against desert locust at Field Station for 
Investigation on Locusts (FSIL) Bikaner.
As per agreement signed between M/s. HIL (India) 
Ltd and Dte. of PPQS for supply of malathion 96% 
Technical ULV grade pesticide for control of Desert 
Locust in the states of Rajasthan & Gujarat. During 
2022-23 season, no locust activity was observed.

More 
Desert Locust Control (August, 2023): -
than normal pre monsoon rain left behind 
favourable ecological conditions for locust 
breeding. Egg Laying probably would have been 
happened during the end of the June, soon after the 
cyclone “Biporjoy” approached at Indo-Pak border. 
First information of hopper emergence was 
received from village Sutharmandi, Mohangarh, 
Jaisalmer district on 09.08.2023. After 
confirmation of low density hoppers of the desert 
locust in a limited area, well equipped control 
teams each from Jaisalmer, Barmer, Phalodi and 
Bikaner were deployed at the infested site to 
combat the situation. Desert Locust Control was 
carried out in 
 ha area from 10.08.2023 to 
836
17.08.2023. 
FAO launched eLocust3mPro (android and iOS 
version app which acts) as new tool to facilitate 
quick and easy transmission of survey data as 
similar to eLocust tabs functions.  Successful 
adoption of eLocust3mPro in place of eLocust3 tabs 
have been made by all LCOs.
Two day Training Programme on use of 
“elocust3mpro”:-
Two days training programme was organized on 
use of elocust3mpro, an android based application 
by using smart phones on 12 , 13  July, 2023 at 
th
th
LWO, Jodhpur. A total of 32 no. of participants 
participated in training programme.
FAO developed a monitoring tool eLocust3g, a 
satellite based tool collection and supplied 65 nos. 
of eLocust3g devices to DPPQS through FAO 
representative India in May, 2022.  These devices 
will be used by the trained Govt. Officials in 
Scheduled Desert Areas of Rajasthan, Gujarat & 
Haryana Sates of India.  Since there is network 
connectivity problem in Scheduled Desert Areas 
these devices can be used in such areas for Desert 
Locust data reporting as these are satellite based.
In 32  SWAC meeting a concept note was proposed 
nd
to develop country specific dashboard so that 
various task can be assigned and monitored 
through eLocust3mPro application.  The proposal 
was appreciated during SWAC meeting and 
dedicated fund is allocated for developing country 
specific dashboard. After implementation of 
dashboard in existing eLocust3mPro.  Data can be 
retrieved as and when required, the extent of 
survey & control operations carried on day basis 
and monthly basis can be monitored.

PLANT HEALTH ENGINEERING DIVISION
Executive Summary
Plant Health Engineering Division mainly focuses 
for m aintaining the plant health using 
interventions through engineering principles. In 
this context, this division has contributed in the 
areas of pesticide application techniques, safety 
measures while handling pesticides, application of 
Remote Sensing & Geographical Information 
Systems in plant health management, post-harvest 
management and storage techniques and also in 
micro-irrigation. Out of these areas, the division's 
major programme is in the area of pesticide 
application techniques and safety measures. There 
are many incidences such as Yavatmal in 
Maharashtra where more than 22 spray operators 
died due to the improper application of pesticides. 
Application of pesticides cannot be avoided and 
hence continues to play a significant role in 
reducing crop losses due to pests even under IPM as 
a last resort. The proper techniques of application 
of these chemicals need to be adopted by the 
farmers to attain result without health issues, so 
that incidents like Yavatmal are not repeated. In this 
context, division continually conducts training 
Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
309
programmes in application and safety aspects to 
Agricultural/extension Officers, farmers and 
entrepreneurs.  
PHE division has organized 16 training 
programmes (08 officers, 03 farmers, 02 students 
programme and 03 exposure visits) and trained 
408 participants.
As part of Research and Development, different 
projects viz., a) Nozzle wear study with municipal 
water as carrier.
With focus on creation of improved awareness in 
pesticide application techniques, the Plant Health 
Engineering Division conducted significant 
number of trainings in pesticide application 
techniques, safety measures while handling 
pesticides. This was with the back drop of various 
alarming incidents of untimely death and health 
issues of farmers due to incorrect application of 
pesticides. In addition to this, training programmes 
in Remote Sensing & Geographical Information 
Systems in Agriculture, post-harvest management 
and storage techniques, water resources, micro-
irrigation and agricultural drone were taken up 
during the year. Application of pesticides continues 
to play a significant role in reducing crop losses due 
to pests even under IPM as a last resort and hence 
proper techniques need to be adopted by the 
farmers to attain result without health issues. Also, 
PHE division has organized one webinar on 
“Synergising Drone Applications in Agriculture.
Most of the trainings programs were organized in 
online mode. Few off-campus programs were 
organized for officers and farmers by following 
Covid protocol. The various trainings conducted at 
diversified levels of participants, research and 
development activities of the division, visits/ 
participation in trainings/ webinars, books/ 
booklet publications etc are detailed below.
Capacity Building Programme:
Capacity building in the area of Plant protection is 
the major focus of the division. Keeping this in view, 
trained and skilled manpower should be available 
to train and empower the farmers/ operators to 
select, calibrate and operate the spray application 
equipment. Sensitization and exposure of 
extension functionaries of State Governments, and 
other stakeholders to the vital aspects of pesticides 
application technology is essential for ensuring 
safe & judicious use of pesticides for enhancing 
food safety and global trade. Water, an important 
component for plant also plays an important role in 
maintaining proper plant health. Similarly, right 
farm equipment helps for timely plant health 
management. Also, advanced technology and tools 
such as Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical 
Information System (GIS) help in decision making 
of plant health management in a quicker manner 
which contributes in efficiency of overall 
agricultural management prac tices. The 
importance of produce produced has to be taken 
care from possible damage due to various factors to 
improve the shelf life and quality and also storage. 
Improper harvesting, handling transportation and 
distribution of fruits and vegetables result in the 
significant losses which cause ultimately economic 
loss. Emphasis of these scenarios is all covered in 
the divisional training programs.

Monitoring of Pesticide Residues at 
National Level Achievements – 2023-24:
 
 
The central sector project on “Monitoring of 
Pesticide Residues at National Level 
(MPRNL)”was initiated during 2005-06 by 
DA&FW to monitor pesticide residues in 
food commodities and water. These samples 
are collec ted by the p articipating 
laboratories and analysed by the NABL 
accredited testing laboratories. 
The main objectives of the project include:
 
Test pesticide residues in food commodities 
and environmental samples like water 
 
Identify crops and regions having 
preponderance of pesticide residues
 
Promote Good Agricultural Practices among 
farmers and implementation of Integrated 
Pest Management (IPM).
The MPRNL project is monitored by two committees, 
namely, Steering Committee and Technical 
Committee. The policy decisions related to the 
scheme are under the preview of the Steering 
Committee headed by the Joint Secretary (Plant 
Protection), Department of Agriculture & Farmers 
Welfare while the decisions related to the technical 
issues are under the purview of the Technical 
Committee, headed by the Assistant Director 
General (Plant Protection& Biosafety), Indian 
Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR). The 
Network Coordinator, All India Network Project on 
Pesticide Residues, IARI, New Delhi is the Scheme In-
Charge and is the nodal person for the day-to-day 
implementation of the project related to financial 
and technical matters and submission of monthly 
reports, annual reports and need based information 
to the Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. 
Under the project, there are 35 participating 
laboratories that collects the samples of food 
commodities such as vegetables, fruits, cereals, 
pulses, spices, herbs, milk, egg, fish/ marine, meat 
and tea as per the approved technical programme 
approved during the annual workshop of the 
scheme from various Agriculture Produce 
Marketing Committee (APMC) markets, local 
markets, farm gate, organic outlets and surface 
water from intensive agricultural fields from 
various parts of the country and analyse for the 
possible presence of pesticide residues. The 
participating laboratoriesrepresent Ministry of

to the various participating laboratories for the 
procurement of chemicals, glassware, reagents, 
CRMs, spare parts, maintenance of equipments, 
sample collection, participation in workshop, 
training, hiring of contractual manpower, sample 
testing, report submission and funds to 
laboratories on per sample basis. 
In order to ensure the uniformity in the 
methodology like sampling, extraction and cleanup 
of the samples, the “Pesticide Residue Analysis 
Manual” reviewed and published by the Indian 
Council of Agricultural Research, has been 
provided and followed by all the participating 
laboratories. In addition to this, need based new 
analytical methods are developed, validated and 
adopted by the laboratories.
All the testing laboratories are selected on the basis 
of NABL accreditation status and availability of the 
instrument's facility under the project, are involved 
in the sample collection as well as analysis of the 
samples.All the testing laboratories under the 
project are maintaining NABL accreditation as per 
ISOIEC 17025:2017 in the field of pesticide residue 
analysis to generate reliable & credible data. The 
sample collection laboratories collect samples from 
the uncovered areas and transport the same to the 
sample testing laboratories for analysis. To 
evaluate the technical competence of the testing 
laboratories under MPRNL project, proficiency 
testing (PT) programme are conducted by NIPHM, 
Hyderabad which is an approved PT provider as per 
ISO/IEC 17043.The performance of the labs is 
evaluated in terms of z score. The reports are 
shared with the participating centers for corrective 
actions and the summary of the z scores are 
reported to the Scheme In charge. In case of any 
deviation root cause analysis is conducted. During 
April-September 2023-24NIPHM, Hyderabad 
conducted two PT programmes in capsicum and 
rice.
Thehands-on training programmesare conducted 
to enhance the knowledge and skills of the 
scientists/ researchers in the scheme. To gain 
exposure to advances in field of food contaminants 
at international level, scientists participate in 
trainings/ seminars/ workshops/ Codex meetings. 
The 36  Technical Committee meeting was 
th
conducted for technical decisions under the 
scheme. The 13 Steering Committee meeting was 
th
held to review the policy related decisions under 
the scheme. The monthly Technical Programme for 
the year 2023-24 was circulated to the

24.1  
Overview
Women play a very important role in agriculture 
and rural development in our country. Agriculture, 
the single largest production endeavor in India is 
contributing substantially to the GDP and is 
increasingly becoming a female activity.
As per the Economic Survey 2022-23, 65 percent 
(2021 data) of the country's population lives in the 
rural areas and 47 per cent of the population is 
dependent on agriculture for livelihood. The 
Government's emphasis on rural development has 
been by way of improving the quality of life in rural 
areas to ensure more equitable and inclusive 
development. The aim of engagement of the 
government in the rural economy has been 
“transforming lives and livelihoods through 
proactive socio-economic inclusion, integration, 
and empowerment of rural India.”
Rural women are increasingly participating in 
economic activity. The economic survey notes the 
noticeable rise in Rural Female Labour Force 
Participation Rate (FLFPR) from 19.7 per cent in 
2018-19 to 27.7 per cent in 2020-21. This upturn in 
the FLFPR is a positive development on the gender 
aspect of employment and could be attributable to 
rising rural amenities freeing up women's time and 
high agricultural growth over the years.
Women play a significant and crucial role in 
agricultural development including, main crop 
production, livestock production, horticulture, 
post-harvesting operations, agro/social forestry, 
fishing, etc. The increasing percentage of female 
operational holders during different Agriculture 
Censuses indicates the participation of more and 
more women in the operation and management of 
agricultural holdings in the country.
In the field of agriculture, women farmers are 
contributing extensively to the development of the 
sector and play multiple roles from being a 
producer, cultivators and entrepreneurs. There is 
empirical evidence that women have a decisive role 
in ensuring food security and preserving local agro-
biodiversity. Rural women are responsible for the 
integrated management and use of diverse natural 
resources to meet daily household needs. The 
agricultural sector is an essential source of 
economic growth, employment, poverty reduction, 
food and nutritional security. Women play a vital 
role in agriculture and therefore, gender-inclusive 
growth and development projects in agriculture 
tend to be effective, socially and economically. 
Bridging the gender gap in access to productive 
resources in agriculture boosts agricultural 
productivity and income.
To fulfill the mission of gender mainstreaming in 
agriculture & allied sectors, the National Gender 
Resource Centre in Agriculture (NGRCA) in 
Extension Division is working as a focal point for 
convergence of gender related activities and issues 
within and outside DA&FW; addressing gender 
dimension to agriculture policies and programmes; 
rendering advocacy/advisory services to the 
States/UTs to internalize gender specific 
interventions. NGRCA aims at forging effective 
fun ctional linkages with other related 
departments, agencies and institutions for women 
empowerment.
The Gender Budget has been made a part of the 
Union Budget of India since 2005 and entails fund 
allocation towards programmes/schemes 
dedicated to women. Through this effort, the 
Government is promoting gender equality with a 
focus on alleviating the gender gap in all sectors and 
at all levels of governance. The Department of 
Agriculture& Farmers Welfare is earmarking funds 
to be used in schemes and programmes aimed at 
bridging the gender gap.

Extension Reforms (ATMA)” implemented since 
2005 has now been included as a Centrally 
Sponsored components of the Sub-Mission on 
Agriculture Extension (SMAE) under Green 
Revolution – Krishonnati Yojana. It is under 
implementation in 739 districts of 28 States & 5 UTs 
of the country. The Scheme promotes decentralized 
farmer-driven and farmer accountable extension 
system through an institutional arrangement for 
technology dissemination in the form of an 
Agricultural Technology Management Agency 
(ATMA) at district level. Under the Scheme, Grants-
in-Aid is released to States with an objective to 
support State Governments efforts of revitalization 
of the extension system and making available the 
latest agricultural technologies in different 
thematic are as to increase agricultural production 
through extension activities viz; Farmers Training, 
Demonstration, Exposure visit, Kisan Mela, 
Mobilization of Farmers Groups and Setting up of

the scheme.  
THE WAY FORWARD: 
Women farmers are backbone of the Indian 
agriculture and are actively involved in every aspect 
of the agricultural sector, farming and food 
production, value chain management to  the 
development and decision  making. Involve women 
in project planning, monitoring and execution stages 
of development projects through Public Private 
Partnerships and investments using Gender Action 
plans; undertaking Gender Analysis; ensuring 
Gender involvement and consultations; Capacity 
Building and gender mainstreaming skills of the staff 
in vo lv e d in  p roje c t d ev elo pm e nt  an d 
implementation; supporting wider activity of 
women across project lifecycle; support 
complementary measures and may be inclusive of 
income generating opportunities.  To provide 
women with better growth opportunities, they 
should be provided with better education, skilling 
and micro-financing opportunities. A multi-sectoral 
strategy to raise awareness among women about the 
government's initiatives and mechanisms should be 
devised. To ensure the engendering development, 
specified pro-women initiatives and actions at the 
lowest level of governance, improvement in basic 
amenities at rural level for reducing their duality of 
burden and working towards the Women 
Development to Women Led Development. Women 
farmers should be re-imagined as architects of 
agriculture sector's progress and development 
rather than being passive recipients of the fruits of 
development. The ripple effects of Women Led 
Development are undeniable as an educated and 
empowered woman will ensure education and 
empowerment of future generations. Initiatives are 
being implemented to address these challenges and 
promote gender equality in agriculture. 
Organizations and governments are working to 
increase women's access to land, credit, and markets, 
as well as providing training and education 
opportunities specifically tailored to women in 
agriculture. By empowering women in agriculture 
and recognizing their vital role, it is possible to 
improve their livelihoods, enhance food security, and 
promote sustainable rural development.
In conclusion, women in agriculture are crucial to 
global food production and rural development. 
Their contributions are significant for ensuring

food security, reducing poverty, and promoting 
sustainable agricultural practices. Therefore, 
recognizing and addressing the challenges they 
face is necessary to ensure gender equality in the 
sector and unlock the full potential of women in 
agriculture.

25.1.8 New Initiatives by Ministry of Finance 
 
and O/o Controller General of Accounts
A. 
e-Bill system’
a)  
The Union Minister for Finance & Corporate 
Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman launched the 
e-Bill system for Central Government 
Ministries on the 46  Civil Accounts Day. New 
th
e-Bill system to enable paperless submission 
and end to end digital processing of bills.
b)  
In a phased manner, the new system will make 
the entire process of submission and backend 
processing of bills completely paperless and 
transparent. Thus, it is a major step forward in 
realizing the vision of “Digital India” and 
promoting ease of doing business.
c)   
The objectives of the system are to:
 
i)  Provide convenience to all vendors/ 
suppliers of the government to submit 
their bills/claims at any time, from 
anywhere.
 
ii)  Eliminate physical interface between 
suppliers and government officers.
 
iii) Enhance efficiency in processing of 
bills/claims.
 
iv)  Reduce discretion in processing of bills 
through “First-In-First-Out”(FIFO) 
method.
d)  
Currently, the suppliers of various goods and 
services to the Government have to submit 
physical, ink signed copies of their bills to the 
respective Ministries/Departments/offices of 
the Government of India. Similarly, the 
government employees also need to submit 
hard copies of their claims. At the backend too, 
the processing of bills is done through a mixed 
system of physical and digital modes. So, the 
suppliers/vendors or their representatives 
need to visit the offices to deliver bills. 
Moreover, they are able to track the status of 
processing of their bills.
e)  
Under the newly launched e-Bill system, 
vendors suppliers can upload their bills 
online along with supporting documents from 
the convenience of their homes/offices at any 
time through digital signature. For those not 
having a digital signature, the facility of e-sign 
using Aadhaar has also been provided. So, the 
suppliers will no longer be required to visit 
the offices concerned for this purpose.
f)  
At the backend too, the electronic bill received 
will be processed by the authorities digitally 
at every stage and finally, the payments will be 
credited digitally to the bank account of the 
vendor. The vendor/supplier would be able to 
track the status of processing of their bills 
online. Thus, the new system will bring in lot 
of efficiency and transparency in the system 
and is a big citizen-centric decision of the 
Government of India.
g)  
The e-Bill system has been developed by the 
Public Financial Management System (PFMS) 
Division in the office of the Controller General 
Annual Report 2023-24
338
of Accounts in  the Departm ent of 
Expenditure, Ministry of Finance. The bills 
will be processed by First-In-First-Out (FIFO) 
method.
h)  
In addition to promoting ease of doing 
business and brining convenience to lakhs of 
vendors/suppliers, the e-Bill system will be 
environment friendly, eliminating the need to 
submit crores of paper bills annually and will 
thus save tonnes of paper every year. The e-
Bill system has an elaborate digital storage 
facility for retrieval of documents and a robust 
audit trail.
