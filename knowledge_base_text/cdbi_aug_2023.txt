Standardized Precipitation Index: 
 
The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is an index used for monitoring drought and is 
based only on precipitation. This index is negative for dry, and positive for wet conditions. As the dry or 
wet conditions become more severe, the index becomes more negative or positive. Fig 7 (a, b, and c) 
gives the SPI values for the month of August 2023, June – August 2023 (3 months cumulative) and 
January 2023 - August 2023 (13 months cumulative) respectively. 
  
 
During August, extremely wet/severely wet conditions were observed over parts of Arunachal 
Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura, Sub Himalayan West 
Bengal & Sikkim, Bihar, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh while, extremely dry/severely dry 
conditions were observed over parts of Assam & Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram &

Percentage of Warm Days /Cold Nights:  
 
Fig 16(a) and 16(b) show the percentage of days when maximum (minimum) temperature was 
more (less) than 90th (10th) percentile. Over 
parts 
of 
Coastal 
Andhra 
Pradesh, 
Telangana, 
Rayalaseema, Tamilnadu, Puducherry & Karaikal, Konkan & Goa, North Interior Karnataka, South 
Interior Karnataka, Coastal Karnataka, Kerala & Mahe and Lakshdweep island maximum temperature 
was greater than 90th percentile for more than 50 % of the days of the month. Over parts of North 
Interior Karnataka and Marathawada minimum temperature was less than 10th percentile for more than 
50% of the days of the month. 
Fig.17 shows  the mean temperature time series for the country as a whole for August since 
1971.  Five year moving average values are also shown. The mean temperature for the month this year 
over the country as a whole was 28.45oC with an anomaly of 0.90oC and highest since 1901.  Over 
South Peninsular India the mean temperature was highest (28.96ºC with an anomaly of 1.30ºC) since 
1901. Over Northwest India the mean temperature was 4th highest (28.04ºC with an anomaly of 0.70ºC) 
after the years 2020(28.24ºC), 2009(28.16ºC) and 1987(28.05ºC) since 1901. Over Central India the 
mean temperature was also 4th highest (27.82ºC with an anomaly of 0.62ºC) after the years 
2009(27.94ºC), 2015(27.90ºC) and 2021(27.88ºC) since 1901. Over East & Northeast India the mean 
temperature was 5th highest (28.74ºC with an anomaly of 0.62ºC) since 1901. 
 
Fig. 18(a) and 18(b) show the maximum and minimum temperature series respectively for the 
country as a whole and the four homogeneous regions during August 2023 since 1971. Both the 
maximum and minimum temperature was above normal over all the homogeneous regions.   Among 
the four homogeneous regions, over South Peninsular India the maximum temperature was highest 
(32.66ºC with an anomaly of 1.73ºC) and the minimum temperature was also highest (25.26ºC with an 
anomaly of 0.86C) since 1901.  Over Central India the maximum temperature was 6th highest (31.05ºC 
with an anomaly of 0.84ºC) and minimum temperature was the 3rd highest (24.58ºC with an anomaly of 
0.40ºC) after the years 2009(24.75ºC), 1998(24.65ºC) since 1901.   Over Northwest India the maximum 
temperature was 9th highest (32.48ºC with an anomaly of 0.70ºC) and minimum temperature was the 4th 
highest (23.61ºC with an anomaly of 0.70ºC) after the years 2020(24.05ºC), 1947(24.00ºC), 
1905(23.86ºC) since 1901.  Over East & Northeast India the maximum temperature was 9th highest 
(32.33ºC with an anomaly of 0.57ºC) and minimum temperature was the 6th highest (25.15ºC with an 
anomaly of 0.67ºC) since 1901. 
   
Over the country as a whole the maximum temperature was the highest (32.19ºC with an 
anomaly of 1.10ºC) and the minimum temperature was the 2nd highest (24.70ºC with an anomaly of 
0.69ºC) after the year 2020 (24.73ºC) since 1901. Table 3 shows temperature anomalies for the month 
over all India and all the four homogeneous regions. Fig. 19(a) and 19(b) daily variation of maximum 
and minimum temperature anomaly over the country and four homogeneous regions during August 
2023.   
 
Low Pressure Systems: 
 
During August 2023 one low pressure area formed over Bay during 18 – 20 August.  
 
SST anomaly over the Indian & Pacific Ocean: 
 
 
Fig. 20 shows the anomaly in sea surface temperature over the tropical Indian and Pacific 
Oceans. During August 2023, positive SSTs were observed over most of the equatorial Pacific 
Ocean. In the north Indian Ocean, positive SST anomalies were observed over most parts of the 
Arabian Sea. 
 
SOI and Pacific SST Index: 
 
SOI (Table 4) was negative (-1.4) during the month. Sea surface temperature anomalies were 
above normal by about 1ºC over all the NINO regions. 
 
Fig. 21 shows the Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecast System (MMCFS) model output forecast 
for ENSO conditions for the coming seasons. Currently, moderate El Niño conditions are prevailing over 
the equatorial Pacific, and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are above average across most of the 
equatorial Pacific Ocean. The latest MMCFS forecast indicates that El Niño conditions are likely to 
persist until the first quarter of next year.
